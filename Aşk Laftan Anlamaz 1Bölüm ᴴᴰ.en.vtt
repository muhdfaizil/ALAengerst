00:00:21.219 --> 00:01:31.695
Episode 1

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.421
Welome Mr Murat

00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:17.437
What's up?

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.324
Same as when you left.

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:21.908
To the company or home?

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.075
Home

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:33.182
Which one?

00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:34.336
Ours

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.721
I thought so

00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:39.982
Then why do you ask?

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:45.021
That is life. It's not certain. I thought maybe you'd make a difference today.

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:46.930
You drive life.

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:49.986
And you know, I do not like change.

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:53.721
Now hurry. They're waiting for me to eat breakfast with them.

00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:54.444
Ipek

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:56.048
Huh.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.640
Girl I'm having a dream where I can smell real Menemen.

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:06.586
Oh, it's not a dream. I can smell it really well.

00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:10.056
Ah, what a nice friend. Asli is probably making us a surprise.

00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:15.294
Don't be ridiculous. Asli is on duty.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:18.273
So who is making the Menemen then?

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:22.427
This is a real Menemen smell.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:27.427
Just like my mother's. It is my mother's

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:30.186
Breakfast is ready! Wake up now!

00:05:30.618 --> 00:05:32.868
And this is the real voice of my mother

00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:33.875
Mother!

00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:34.841
That's my mother!

00:05:36.748 --> 00:05:38.159
What is my mother doing here?

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.628
Wake up now, lazy girls

00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:42.758
When did you come mother?

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.665
At 6.

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:46.975
What are you doing with my stuff?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.240
I'm packing it.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.609
But why aunt Emine?

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.238
Her father says this is enough.

00:05:51.482 --> 00:05:52.522
He said "Go and get the girl."

00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:54.761
You know what your father says, happens

00:05:55.703 --> 00:06:00.071
He said "Well, her school is finished and she can't find a job, so she has to come back home.

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.547
He said "She left to go to school but hasn't returned"

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:06.023
"From now on, she will be by my side."

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.092
I swear I did not say this, your father did.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.853
My father said all of this? But I spoke to him and did not say anything.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:25.967
My daughter dear, of course he wouldn't say it to you! Your dad wont leave me alone! Always complaining.

00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:30.159
Welcome aunt Emine.... Goodbye Hayat.

00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:33.981
Here, take this!

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.148
What's our move?

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:24.415
Do you prefer an aggressive approach or constructive?

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.201
Should we attack or retreat now and then attack from behind?

00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:32.162
Let him pass.

00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:36.199
You sure? There's no turning back.

00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:37.758
I'm sure.

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:08.067
When are you going to grow up?

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:12.787
You still want to play with me, so much time has passed, only the size of cars increased.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.682
An older brother is enough for a household.

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:17.296
And I'm quite happy with my situation...

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:20.613
Welcome, brother.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.260
Welcome.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:24.516
But right from the road was ours, Mr. Doruk.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.045
This is how life is without mercy, dear Kerem.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.594
An attack can change the entire balance.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:32.148
So bro, what did you do?

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:33.833
Did you conquer Ankara for us?

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:37.167
Did you increase power to the Sarsilmaz name?

00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:40.576
Something like that. What about you. Where do you come from at this hour?

00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:43.462
Oh, and we have a meeting today. You know, right?

00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:47.167
I do not want to go into details, but it was a busy night.

00:08:47.623 --> 00:08:50.410
Even if it wasn't like your performance in Ankara.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.469
I had a small operation to extinguish a flashlight.

00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:56.328
So I think I'll sleep all day.

00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:01.087
The discussion is closed. You have 30 minutes. Get ready, we're leaving together.

00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:03.268
They truly persecute me in this house!

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:09.497
Welcome!

00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:13.834
Remember, we have half an hour.

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:18.447
But you see, half an hour is not enough to be able to finish the questioning from grandma.

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:30.797
How's it going, my sultan.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.254
Where have you been, little donkey, huh?

00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:38.202
You know I was in Ankara for work.

00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:40.971
I know that much! I have not become that senile, thank the Lord.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.733
But tell me, what took you so long?

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:46.356
Well, it was necessary.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.219
What?

00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:52.345
Don't tell me that there is a bride you have found in Ankara that you haven't told us about.

00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:55.518
You know, you're not going to reveal easily.

00:09:56.368 --> 00:10:01.346
Look, if she is from Ankara, that's good. It's the capital. The girls there are good.

00:10:02.093 --> 00:10:04.273
Come on, I don't ask for too much.

00:10:04.733 --> 00:10:06.152
She should at least be decent.

00:10:06.936 --> 00:10:12.046
Have an education and the ability to cook.

00:10:13.043 --> 00:10:16.673
Be fertile and respectful of elders, that's all.

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:20.623
Seriously, I was just there to work.

00:10:21.094 --> 00:10:22.776
Now forget about me, tell me about yourself.

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:24.151
How are you, good?

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:30.509
Come on boy, how can I be better? Living under the same roof with that sinister woman, how can I be better?

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:31.919
Do not say that, she will hear you!

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.491
Eh! Is it a lie?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.490
Come on now.

00:10:35.098 --> 00:10:37.712
You are so cute.

00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:38.868
Derya!

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:39.854
Yes?

00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:43.980
Somehow, you have not managed to get ready yet.

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:46.666
Are you saying I'm slow, Nejat?

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.318
See, I'm getting ready.

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.082
Can you hurry up a little bit, please?

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.110
I'm sure Murat is already here.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:53.531
And what?

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:55.389
He came for breakfast this morning!

00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:58.329
This boy is punctual, let's not make him wait.

00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.026
So you're saying that I love to make people wait?

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.300
Oh of course, we shouldn't make Mr Murat wait.

00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:18.259
Good morning!

00:11:18.324 --> 00:11:19.682
Good morning, dear Murat!

00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:21.634
I told them to prepare breakfast outside.

00:11:21.995 --> 00:11:22.695
Oh, I know.

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:24.703
Do you need something, dear?

00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:26.461
No, I'm going to wake Doruk.

00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.104
Doruk came?

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.059
He came and he went straight to sleep, so that's why I'm suspicious.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.748
If he came back in the morning, let the poor boy sleep.

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:39.553
Woe woe woe, the conqueror of Ankara.

00:11:39.856 --> 00:11:40.757
Welcome!

00:11:40.907 --> 00:11:41.681
Come here!

00:11:46.064 --> 00:11:47.631
How did the meetings go?

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.234
Ankara is fine. It's now time for the Milanese group.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.619
Oh... That meeting is today, isn't it Murat?

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:57.708
Where is Doruk? Has he not woken up yet?

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.764
He came in the morning Nejat, let him sleep.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.236
What do you mean?

00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:04.811
Go and wake him, he should come to the meeting too.

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:06.824
Nejat dear, let the boy sleep.

00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:09.976
Indiscipline has its price, does it not dear?

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:13.079
He will leave tired today.

00:12:36.812 --> 00:12:41.552
Asli, you're just in time! Do you have Sublingual Tablets? I'll take anything you have!

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:45.675
Fadik aunt, look like a drug store?

00:12:46.264 --> 00:12:49.177
I'm just a nurse!

00:12:49.888 --> 00:12:50.898
What is going on?

00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:52.353
Hell is breaking loose inside!

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.039
Why? What happened?

00:12:54.598 --> 00:12:56.089
Aunt Emine came.

00:12:56.748 --> 00:12:58.718
That's good!

00:12:58.805 --> 00:12:59.761
I'm glad she came!

00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:02.909
That's what I said too.

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:06.615
I said "Hello dear, how are you?"

00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:09.536
And what did she say? My dear aunt Emine.

00:13:10.382 --> 00:13:12.242
Hayat's father has told her to come get her.

00:13:12.717 --> 00:13:16.314
Since she could not find a job, she has to return to her hometown.

00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:18.710
How?

00:13:19.092 --> 00:13:21.387
Emine aunt came to take Hayat back to her hometown?

00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:23.219
But she can't do that!

00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:26.539
My daughter did they put tranquillisers in your tea at the hospital?

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:29.188
They're going at each other! Mother and daughter!

00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:33.302
Someone must intervene now.

00:13:33.508 --> 00:13:34.137
Run.

00:13:34.276 --> 00:13:34.997
Run.

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:40.590
If you're going have me by your side, why did you let me study here in the first place?!

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:42.566
Oh you studied? So what did you study!

00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.817
What is happening!

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.206
By the way, welcome, aunt Emine.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.200
I came well, I came good, but I'm not pleased with what I met.

00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:56.537
Aunt Fadik, please tell her something. My mother wants to take me back as if I'm a child.

00:13:56.866 --> 00:13:58.706
Why are you doing this, Emine?

00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:00.657
I'm not doing anything!

00:14:00.762 --> 00:14:04.526
Her father is doing it! "Today is the last night," he said and that's it.

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:07.561
But Mom, today I have two interviews.

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:10.202
And that is exactly what your father said.

00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:14.698
He said "If she finds a job today it's fine. But if she fails, take her hand and bring her here."

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.001
Should we buy bus tickets now?

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:21.428
Or should we leave it for after breakfast?

00:14:21.605 --> 00:14:22.674
Thanks a lot, Ipek.

00:14:23.804 --> 00:14:24.664
Oh, what can I do?

00:14:25.387 --> 00:14:27.178
You think it's easy to find yourself a job in Istanbul?

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.540
Emine aunt huh? Your father is right.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.579
Why do you say such things?

00:14:32.116 --> 00:14:33.637
That's life, you can never know what will happen.

00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:36.254
No, I am Hayat and what will happen is crystal clear.

00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:40.330
Also, I am already legal age. You can't force me to do something I don't want.

00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:46.671
Your father said he will not send anything, not even a penny.

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:53.034
Stay here to see how hungry you'll be, even if you are of legal age.

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:57.779
Oh, why should she sit here hungry? I am here too. I have a lot to feel everyone.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:04.176
Fadik! Don't be on their side. You're the one who gives them hope anyway.

00:15:05.341 --> 00:15:06.151
My girl!

00:15:06.151 --> 00:15:11.651
Today is final. Either you find a job today, or else you go back home.

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:12.824
That's it.

00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:19.634
I swear it's not me. All her father.

00:15:31.257 --> 00:15:33.957
Now, since the whole family is here,

00:15:34.722 --> 00:15:36.662
I want to tell you all something.

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.908
I'm deciding to retire.

00:15:46.476 --> 00:15:54.609
I will come and I will go now, six months from now, I'll quit.

00:15:56.606 --> 00:15:57.366
I do not understand.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.690
What will happen after this six months?

00:16:01.778 --> 00:16:03.498
I will look at your performance.

00:16:04.478 --> 00:16:07.377
And decide who will become the head of the company.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:11.534
But no need to do that. Doruk and I can lead very well together.

00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:12.937
I agree!

00:16:14.365 --> 00:16:16.706
A job only has one boss, Murat.

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:22.936
Even if you are brothers; if there is a dispute, who will decide the final? Huh?

00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:31.648
Dad is right. This job has one boss and that would be you. I can continue my life as it is.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:33.226
This is great!

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:36.705
There is no time for jokes, dear Doruk.

00:16:37.472 --> 00:16:39.742
Your father is talking about an important issue.

00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:43.011
Your mother really says something for the first time.

00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:54.172
Look at how your dad's company has grown. It has given us success. In the future, you will want the same with your children.

00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:58.572
Speaking of kids...

00:16:58.737 --> 00:17:05.769
Oh, mother, please, if you start talking about children and grandchildren, it will never end.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.893
Exactly grandma. Plus Doruk and I do not have time now, right Doruk?

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:13.569
Brother, you leave before me and after I eat this fruit salad, I'll catch up, I promise.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.859
Good appetite.

00:17:36.404 --> 00:17:38.074
What happened. Why are we stopping?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.741
We've overheated.

00:17:40.073 --> 00:17:41.314
What do we do now?

00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:42.996
We'll see. Let me go have a look.

00:18:13.782 --> 00:18:14.714
So, Kerem?

00:18:15.048 --> 00:18:15.989
The water has finished.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.695
What?

00:18:16.808 --> 00:18:18.008
It has no water.

00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:19.183
Bring the water and then let's go.

00:18:19.418 --> 00:18:20.758
The engine has to cool down first.

00:18:20.938 --> 00:18:22.124
I'll be late.

00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:23.975
I'll call the company and tell them to bring another car.

00:18:24.158 --> 00:18:27.018
Leave it, leave it. Not enough time. I will take a taxi.

00:18:40.814 --> 00:18:42.054
Stay at home a bit!

00:18:42.628 --> 00:18:44.453
Everyone wants to take a taxi, especially today.

00:18:45.139 --> 00:18:48.098
I gotta get to this interview! If I don't get the job, I have to go back home!

00:18:49.737 --> 00:18:53.647
There is something called public transportation! Wh is everyone after this luxury?

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.630
Taxi!

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.629
Oh no, that's not a taxi.

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:08.712
Sorry.

00:19:10.453 --> 00:19:11.682
Where to, beautiful.

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:19.333
The pits of hell, you want to come with me?

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:23.109
Get out of here! Don't be confused by my looks, I'll attack you with my tongue!

00:19:25.558 --> 00:19:26.239
Leave!

00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:27.019
Huh, beautiful.

00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:28.560
Rude!

00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:30.232
Snob...

00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:42.727
Are you free?

00:19:42.952 --> 00:19:46.017
Of course! I just ordered a toast here, I'm going to take it and come immediately.

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:46.655
Okay.

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:52.953
Okay, okay. I'll close it, let's go.

00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:54.852
But this is my cab.

00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:59.228
Congratulations, but I didn't ask who's it was. I said let's go.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.091
No, you've misunderstood.

00:20:01.259 --> 00:20:04.415
Please, sir, you haven't understood me at all. I don't have time for a big delay. I'm late, let's go!

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.990
Lady, please leave, I'm getting in this cab.

00:20:07.256 --> 00:20:09.367
Of course, you'll get in, so we can go.

00:20:09.449 --> 00:20:10.721
How would you drive without getting in?

00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.021
Anyway that's the problem.

00:20:12.066 --> 00:20:13.616
I'm not a driver, I am a customer.

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:22.033
You are no longer a customer.

00:20:22.112 --> 00:20:23.246
And why is that?

00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:28.614
Because my job is very urgent. In fact, this is a life and death situation.

00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:29.976
My job is also urgent.

00:20:29.976 --> 00:20:31.465
We can go together if you want.

00:20:31.555 --> 00:20:33.519
I get off at my destination, then you continue yours.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.390
For what?

00:20:35.663 --> 00:20:37.969
Why should I go in taxi with a stranger?

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:41.050
Do you know the taxi driver?

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:41.670
No.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.000
But you will go in the same car with him.

00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:45.103
There's a difference, do you understand?

00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:46.357
How so?

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:49.447
Okay fine!

00:20:49.937 --> 00:20:52.699
I would rather walk than go by taxi with a man I don't know.

00:20:53.096 --> 00:20:55.275
Two men that you do not know. The taxi driver is a stranger too.

00:20:59.296 --> 00:20:59.997
Are you okay?

00:21:03.522 --> 00:21:04.581
You're inhumane!

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.130
A monument of selfishness!

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.139
What else should you be?

00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:19.135
Monument of selfishness?

00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:23.175
It's good now brother, come, where are we going?

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:24.878
Do you know the Sarte building?

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:25.771
The one in Levent?

00:21:25.878 --> 00:21:26.298
Exactly.

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:40.574
If you do not want to answer the phone, please put it on silent. It's bothering me.

00:21:41.069 --> 00:21:42.681
Same thing I wanted to tell you myself.

00:21:42.752 --> 00:21:44.156
The phone that is ringing is not mine.

00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:46.445
It's not mine either.

00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:54.526
She must have dropped the phone.

00:21:55.227 --> 00:21:57.707
We'll give the phone to the Lady and then continue our way.

00:21:57.795 --> 00:21:58.477
Okay.

00:22:02.341 --> 00:22:04.922
Did all the troublesome people agree to ruin my day?

00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:07.556
There bet around. Who will make Hayat lose her minds first?

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.899
Mate, am I a betting coupon?

00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:12.797
Look at that man "Do you know the taxi driver?"

00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:14.011
Yeah, sure, I know him!

00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:14.599
Miss!

00:22:14.653 --> 00:22:16.383
He is a friend of my father's!

00:22:17.446 --> 00:22:20.226
He has logic, but gentlemanly actions? Zero!

00:22:20.754 --> 00:22:21.613
Miss!

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.479
What is happening-

00:22:26.724 --> 00:22:28.405
Are you following me?!

00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:29.495
No no.

00:22:30.962 --> 00:22:32.296
What do you have in your hand then?

00:22:32.582 --> 00:22:33.455
A phone.

00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:36.422
Are you trying to ask for my number?!

00:22:36.846 --> 00:22:40.189
Look lady, you've got it wrong again and my patience is ending.

00:22:40.311 --> 00:22:42.255
I misunderstood what? What did I misunderstand?

00:22:42.283 --> 00:22:44.038
Look at the man. His patience is ending.

00:22:44.175 --> 00:22:46.990
You're shoving the phone in my face as an excuse to ask for my number!

00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:48.182
Give me that!

00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:54.308
What did you do?!

00:22:54.361 --> 00:22:56.388
I drew the line, enough!

00:24:12.157 --> 00:24:12.899
Stop, wait.

00:24:13.908 --> 00:24:14.745
Have a good day!

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.530
If my eyes are finally free of this prison, I request the payment and discharge.

00:24:51.587 --> 00:24:53.768
What are you trying to do, Nejat?

00:24:55.602 --> 00:25:00.083
You put a stick of dynamite inbetween two brothers.

00:25:00.512 --> 00:25:02.434
You make them fight each other.

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:06.054
Of course not, they wouldn't do that mother.

00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:10.264
Of course they will not, but your wife will.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.309
Oh mother...

00:25:14.153 --> 00:25:16.880
I don't know why you can't get along with her.

00:25:18.164 --> 00:25:24.506
That Derya has a problem with us.

00:25:25.586 --> 00:25:27.072
For God's sake, mother, please.

00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:31.318
Who is "we"? And who is Derya? What are you trying to say?

00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:36.318
We are the Sarsilmaz family, and she is the third party trying to separate us!

00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:39.842
You mean our end is an uphill battle?

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:47.939
Go ahead. Mock me. If Murat becomes the head of the company, World War 3 will begin!

00:25:48.137 --> 00:25:49.072
Mother...

00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:52.987
Murat Doruk and are the same for me.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.541
But you also know, as the youngest, his head is in the clouds and irresponsible.

00:26:00.491 --> 00:26:04.671
I hope he will wised and return when he will be burdened with responsibility.

00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:07.249
Or, we both know...

00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:10.721
Murat will head the company in the end.

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.355
Welcome, Mr. Murat.

00:26:35.369 --> 00:26:37.144
I want the product quality reports on my desk by 4.

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:38.845
The reports before 4.

00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:45.253
What about statistics required for group meeting with Milan?

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.171
It's ready, sir.

00:26:46.914 --> 00:26:51.593
But... There is a small problem with this.

00:26:51.883 --> 00:26:52.653
What is it?

00:26:53.013 --> 00:26:55.718
They called five minutes ago and said they would be late.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.724
Well, the meeting starts in 10 minutes anyway, doesn't it?

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:01.460
Yes, they said they would be delayed for up to an hour.

00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:13.160
Cancel the meeting, but don't inform them.

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:16.304
The meeting is cancelled, they will not be informed.

00:27:18.122 --> 00:27:19.422
What do you mean, sir?

00:27:19.722 --> 00:27:24.249
You'll inform about the cancellation of the meeting, when they will arrive. They will be taught about not wasting other's time.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.262
Milan meeting is cancelled. Boss is very angry!

00:27:30.831 --> 00:27:31.992
Why has the lift slowed down?

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.082
Something went wrong yesterday, I informed the repair service. It should resolve immediately.

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:37.313
Immediately is too late.

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.451
The issue ought to be solved yesterday.

00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:44.545
It't too late now. Yesterday. Yesterday!

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:53.366
How's the photography for the catalogue? Has it begun?

00:27:53.407 --> 00:27:55.487
Yes, everything is going according to schedule.

00:27:56.189 --> 00:27:57.327
Let me confirm.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.331
I couldn't reach you. What happened? Did you get the job?

00:28:12.354 --> 00:28:14.349
One second. Asli called too. Let me add her.

00:28:17.637 --> 00:28:21.289
Hayat I need to know, please tell me you got the job and don't have to go home!

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:25.410
Admit it, you couldn't do it. Well, we'll send a bus at the end of the evening.

00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:30.030
I don't know because a few moments ago, I didn't come our of an interview, but a dumpster.

00:28:30.255 --> 00:28:33.000
What? Did you not have the interview in Maslak?

00:28:33.347 --> 00:28:37.337
Oh, Ipek, please don't push it. I'm in no mood for jokes.

00:28:37.522 --> 00:28:41.847
I could not get a cab and then I threw the phone in the trash because of an annoying man!

00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:47.796
Oh, girl, why did you take your anger out on the phone? It was almost new, you could have used for a long time!

00:28:47.904 --> 00:28:50.341
Girls, it's not what it seems. I'll explain when I come home.

00:28:50.806 --> 00:28:53.188
People would think he's a decent man. That snob!

00:28:53.622 --> 00:28:56.202
So you're saying that he was hansome?

00:28:56.853 --> 00:29:04.954
Look, take notes, next time you see a beautiful boy, give him your number, do not throw it in the trash.

00:29:05.152 --> 00:29:08.419
If I see him again, I know what I will do.

00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:10.183
What will you do?

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.950
I'll give him what he deserves, Asli!

00:29:12.992 --> 00:29:16.768
Nevermind, I should go. I missed the first interview, I shouldn't miss the second.

00:29:16.847 --> 00:29:18.267
What's next?

00:29:19.513 --> 00:29:22.263
Secretary position at the textile company, Sarte.

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:57.795
Guys, I can see that the right shoulder of her dress has fallen. Fix it!

00:29:57.857 --> 00:29:59.757
We're waiting for Lady Didem but...

00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:01.663
Just do as I say.

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:09.828
Didem, dear. What is the problem?

00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:12.310
I think it's a shine on the left side of my chin.

00:30:13.922 --> 00:30:16.638
I wish her the brightness disappears so we can do the work.

00:30:17.034 --> 00:30:18.336
Dear!

00:30:20.312 --> 00:30:24.948
You have such a wonderful physique that no one will notice your chin.

00:30:26.331 --> 00:30:28.007
Can you see the mole on my leg?

00:30:28.308 --> 00:30:30.874
That's not a problem Miss Didem, we can edit it.

00:30:32.225 --> 00:30:33.080
Okay.

00:30:37.463 --> 00:30:38.323
Okay

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:40.020
We'll start, if you're ready.

00:30:41.002 --> 00:30:42.135
Okay, very good.

00:30:47.431 --> 00:30:48.512
Now what?

00:30:48.922 --> 00:30:51.242
Tuval, my nail varnish is ruined!

00:30:53.082 --> 00:30:55.573
Think of it as a talisman, okay honey? Let's continue.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.030
Okay

00:30:58.861 --> 00:30:59.742
Okay, I'm taking the photo's now.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.085
That's great.

00:31:05.712 --> 00:31:06.602
Murat!

00:31:09.681 --> 00:31:10.691
Welcome, dear!

00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:13.232
I don't want to interrupt, continue.

00:31:21.572 --> 00:31:22.951
Welcome, dear Murat.

00:31:26.332 --> 00:31:27.315
How's it going, Tuval?

00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:30.531
We'll see but we haven't got the chance to start!

00:31:30.594 --> 00:31:31.924
How is the decor, Mr. Murat?

00:31:33.145 --> 00:31:33.954
What is the theme?

00:31:34.348 --> 00:31:40.485
The theme is this: Ms. Didem is a socialite and she wears one of our dresses at a party.

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:44.246
And she will do this lying down on a couch?

00:31:44.395 --> 00:31:45.176
What?

00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:47.449
If she is going to a party, why is she on a couch?

00:31:49.912 --> 00:31:50.621
Serdar?

00:31:51.391 --> 00:31:52.401
Yes, Mr. Murat.

00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:53.960
Why is Didem on the couch?

00:31:55.412 --> 00:31:57.761
Since the pictures come out better when I'm lying.

00:32:00.528 --> 00:32:04.058
We're not trying to see Ms. Didem, but the dress, Serdar huh?

00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:05.161
You are right, Mr. Murat.

00:32:06.095 --> 00:32:07.675
Of course, we also know this.

00:32:10.193 --> 00:32:11.752
Please do what needs to be done.

00:32:37.082 --> 00:32:39.393
Did he something bad about me, Tuval?

00:32:40.385 --> 00:32:44.045
You're so carefree.

00:32:45.822 --> 00:32:47.942
We must not be affected by the evil eye.

00:32:49.459 --> 00:32:51.110
Everyone wants Murat.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.237
They are jealous because we have a relationship.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.786
Oh, so you and Murat are in a relationship?

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.791
Yeah, we see each other 5 days a week.

00:32:59.312 --> 00:33:03.903
Yes, you see, because you are working in the same company.

00:33:04.235 --> 00:33:07.966
No, we go to launch ceremonies and meetings together, too.

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:10.430
Wow. We do too.

00:33:10.449 --> 00:33:11.525
Regardless.

00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:15.708
He responds to my messages and call me back when I call.

00:33:16.314 --> 00:33:19.206
And you know, sometimes I spend the night at his house.

00:33:21.912 --> 00:33:26.921
Because he is kind, dear. Plus, a reply and response have the same intentions. It would be better if you knew that.

00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:32.481
Then what is my connection with Murat, if not a relationship?

00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:39.750
Spending time for fun. Murat does not like commitments and expectations.

00:33:42.266 --> 00:33:43.512
Look, Tuval.

00:33:44.366 --> 00:33:52.248
If I say that I have a relationship with a man, then I do. If not, I'll make it happen. Anything I want, happens.

00:33:52.343 --> 00:33:53.276
Capiche?

00:33:55.772 --> 00:33:56.357
Not capiche.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.668
Do not forget that the other side is Murat.

00:34:00.785 --> 00:34:03.225
Murat, Surat, not a problem. They are men anyway.

00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:30.074
Did you finish early?

00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:33.568
I waited for the group Milan, but none came.

00:34:33.688 --> 00:34:34.414
I cancelled it.

00:34:36.197 --> 00:34:38.539
Murat Sarslimaz spitting again.

00:34:38.793 --> 00:34:40.695
In short, it is one of those lucky days.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.235
As if that was not enough...

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.208
My dad called now. He said he had an old friend, Mr Kemal, and to wants to hire his daughter.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.058
As an assistant.

00:34:49.415 --> 00:34:50.475
And what's wrong with that?

00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:54.964
Her father told our father to give her a hard time and show her the business world.

00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:58.122
You need to be yourself, that's enough.

00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:01.629
It's not professional. I don't want to work with someone I can't fire.

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.297
At least, is the girl is beautiful?

00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:10.016
Thanks, Cagla.

00:35:10.352 --> 00:35:11.623
Enjoy your drink, Mr. Murat.

00:35:13.196 --> 00:35:14.104
Enjoy.

00:35:18.689 --> 00:35:21.770
So here is the cage in which your dad wants to close you in, my love.

00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:23.760
Yes, honey, but he will not be successful.

00:35:24.327 --> 00:35:28.828
I'll do the interview quickly and tell my dad that we couldn't get along; that they didn't hire me.

00:35:29.133 --> 00:35:32.123
Well, honey, the job is basically yours. What will you do?

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:37.009
I'll do everything I can to lose the job. I've lived my life until now as my father wanted.

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:39.663
I learned 4 languages because he wanted me to.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.770
But now it's enough. I want to live my own life.

00:35:43.423 --> 00:35:46.893
What if you tell your father the truth?

00:35:47.297 --> 00:35:49.948
Dad can not tell a bird from a crow, Gokce.

00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:55.832
He will die when I will say that I want to watch the birds with my friend and I want to live in a tent.

00:35:56.847 --> 00:36:02.097
He wont understand us. Don't worry, I'll handle everything.

00:36:44.751 --> 00:36:45.721
Yes, sir.

00:36:46.097 --> 00:36:49.027
Excuse me, I came for an interview.

00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:50.123
Me too.

00:36:50.203 --> 00:36:51.047
4th floor.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.563
Thank you.

00:37:53.693 --> 00:37:55.974
A girl, Suna Pektas, has already received job.

00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:04.720
I work hard. Crawling my way here.

00:38:05.019 --> 00:38:08.168
I hate it most how these people get the job they want without effort.

00:38:08.388 --> 00:38:10.559
You're right, Cagla.

00:38:10.993 --> 00:38:15.666
Plus, these girls study abroad at the expense of their fathers and then come here.

00:38:18.137 --> 00:38:20.198
Why, it takes so long to get to the 4th floor.

00:38:21.782 --> 00:38:23.332
Why does it go slowly?

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.560
It's a bit broken. It will be repaired soon.

00:38:26.375 --> 00:38:29.246
Mr Murat hates these types of support. Support from money.

00:38:29.571 --> 00:38:37.012
You havent heard the best part. Mr Murat will surely make this girl's life miserable.

00:38:38.042 --> 00:38:39.992
Now I feel bad for her.

00:38:46.402 --> 00:38:47.623
Not coming?

00:39:09.708 --> 00:39:12.088
What the hell? I come across maniacs all day!

00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:29.021
What? 4 languages?

00:39:30.445 --> 00:39:31.519
What school?

00:39:32.288 --> 00:39:33.617
University of Michigan?

00:39:34.795 --> 00:39:38.435
Bravo, she worked hard.

00:39:39.587 --> 00:39:41.498
She even has a master's degree.

00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:45.031
Japanese, Russian, Arabic, English.

00:39:48.393 --> 00:39:50.102
She really does not need help.

00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:52.840
They would hire her without her dad's help.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.459
Excuse me, I'm here for an interview.

00:40:13.569 --> 00:40:15.079
Well, last office on the right.

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:16.330
Thank you.

00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:17.223
With pleasure.

00:40:25.086 --> 00:40:25.727
Hi.

00:40:25.795 --> 00:40:27.132
I came for the interview.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.540
Welcome, Suna...

00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:32.151
Pektas! We were expecting you.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.280
No, it's not like that-

00:40:33.371 --> 00:40:36.353
Yes, yes it is. Nejat told us what to do.

00:40:36.648 --> 00:40:44.718
You work as an assistant. You need to complete and sign this contract and you'll bring it tomorrow, when you start.

00:40:45.016 --> 00:40:45.778
Tomorrow?

00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:47.566
Would you have wanted to start next week?

00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:48.989
What?

00:40:49.257 --> 00:40:51.527
Oh, you don't like the position.

00:40:51.956 --> 00:40:53.685
No, no, that's not it.

00:40:54.065 --> 00:40:56.546
What? TL 3000?

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:58.616
That's the minimum wage.

00:41:01.203 --> 00:41:03.625
Yes? Yeah, I'm coming now.

00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:05.337
See you tomorrow.

00:41:06.907 --> 00:41:07.477
Hey!

00:41:09.864 --> 00:41:11.466
She said 3,000 lira!

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.011
But Suna Pektas

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.131
But mom...

00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:42.734
You again?

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.010
I wanted to ask you the same thing myself.

00:41:45.554 --> 00:41:49.404
Let me tell you now, you underestimate me and can't fool me with the 'I'm not following you' tricks.

00:41:49.444 --> 00:41:50.267
I'm not afraid at all.

00:41:50.547 --> 00:41:51.730
This is my job.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.289
What coincidence. It's mine too.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.321
If you'd let me, I'm going down.

00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:04.612
Just in case you worry about going in the same elevator with an unknown man.

00:42:17.128 --> 00:42:18.539
What department do you work?

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:19.900
Why you ask?

00:42:20.736 --> 00:42:22.814
Since I have not seen you before.

00:42:24.294 --> 00:42:28.171
Personal care assistance to the assistant head. I mean, I just became it a little while ago.

00:42:30.036 --> 00:42:31.337
So it's you.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.671
What? Do not you like?

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:38.466
And maybe you are the commissioner employer.

00:42:40.914 --> 00:42:41.897
Something like that.

00:42:42.809 --> 00:42:44.430
It's good to know who you are.

00:42:52.211 --> 00:42:53.532
Why has it stopped?

00:42:54.509 --> 00:42:55.558
It's broken.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.213
Broken? How is it broken?

00:42:58.596 --> 00:43:01.687
Why has it stopped? Will it stand it? We're stuck here?

00:43:01.892 --> 00:43:04.038
I'm just a commissioner. I don't know anything about elevators.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.200
Get me out of here!

00:43:06.419 --> 00:43:10.060
I gotta get out of here! I'm claustrophobic, look, I can not breathe.

00:43:10.334 --> 00:43:12.648
Hurry. Do something, quick.

00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:14.138
At your command.

00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:16.007
Do something, I'm not kidding.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.261
I can't breathe. I'm going to have a panic attack.

00:43:18.678 --> 00:43:20.178
Huh

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:24.432
I know what they need to do to claustrophobic people but do not go crazy again.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.531
Do it. Do whatever you know.

00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:29.489
I can't breathe. I know myself, I'm going to have a panic attack.

00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:33.098
Okay

00:44:13.188 --> 00:44:17.619
Relax, it's gone.

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:21.136
You're safe, okay, relax.

00:44:21.136 --> 00:44:23.576
You're better, alright?

00:44:27.476 --> 00:44:28.416
Relax.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.793
What a nice smell you have.

00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:42.525
What is this? You're taking advantage of the situation just to compliment me. Let go!

00:44:42.643 --> 00:44:43.974
Don't leave or you will be worse.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.920
I said leave me!

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:46.669
No, keep your word a little.

00:44:46.753 --> 00:44:48.145
You told me to help you and I held you.

00:44:48.192 --> 00:44:49.237
And now I'm saying let me go.

00:44:49.427 --> 00:44:49.986
No.

00:44:51.111 --> 00:44:53.208
When the lift starts working again, I will leave you, I promise.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.361
At least admit it, I distracted and prevented your panic attack.

00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:14.918
See you.

00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:28.847
What is he doing? Pervert.

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.358
What is happening?

00:46:11.117 --> 00:46:13.437
Doruk, it's you. What are you doing?

00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:16.261
What can I say? I was charmed by you.

00:46:17.044 --> 00:46:19.553
I swear, you draw like a magnet.

00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:28.792
If it is a crime to look good and be attractive, then arrest me. It's okay.

00:46:30.155 --> 00:46:32.828
But you have a life sentence, Tuval Yanikoglu.

00:46:33.086 --> 00:46:37.356
Those who touch you.... they burn their hands.

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.792
That's how hot you are.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:43.554
You're so sweet. Come here let me smell you.

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.723
No, not you either.

00:46:47.469 --> 00:46:50.471
I'm going to go crazy! Where is this smell coming from?!

00:46:51.157 --> 00:46:51.938
What smell?

00:46:53.292 --> 00:46:56.612
The smell of love is in the air, sweetheart. Do you not smell it?

00:46:57.836 --> 00:46:58.567
No.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.970
Look, this body is a radar love, okay?

00:47:03.793 --> 00:47:04.893
This nose never is wrong.

00:47:05.192 --> 00:47:07.899
Anytime I smell this, a love blossoms.

00:47:08.673 --> 00:47:11.472
Kenan, Sinem, Beren, Kenan, Halit, Berguzar (all actors)

00:47:11.664 --> 00:47:13.085
I smelled all of those with this nose.

00:47:15.473 --> 00:47:20.000
Seriously, you scare me, Tuval.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.611
I am not the crazy one. Love is.

00:47:28.029 --> 00:47:30.839
But why is love here in Sarte?

00:47:32.455 --> 00:47:40.285
Do not talk like that. It is unexpected. It will suddenly appear in front of you when you least expect it.

00:47:40.864 --> 00:47:45.682
Fall into it's hands, it will burn through you. Write this somewhere.

00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:50.294
Love cannot be understood through words.

00:48:12.675 --> 00:48:16.327
Brother, she begins the conversation with cologne and candy. We're done.

00:48:17.197 --> 00:48:19.149
What do you want to tell us, Grandma?

00:48:20.725 --> 00:48:22.744
Take some candy first.

00:48:26.991 --> 00:48:28.935
Have some cologne.

00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:29.785
Okay.

00:48:32.636 --> 00:48:36.032
Grandma, sweets are okay but cologne is really not necessary.

00:48:36.032 --> 00:48:41.172
But if you insist so much, we can not refuse, right brother?

00:48:49.683 --> 00:48:51.406
Did we do something wrong without knowing so?

00:48:54.085 --> 00:49:00.865
I'm the guilty one since I did not get you married after you graduated.

00:49:01.418 --> 00:49:06.409
Oh, and I knew the discussions on grandchildren and marriage wouldn't really be over. So great!

00:49:06.675 --> 00:49:09.257
Don't joke about this, Doruk.

00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:16.759
Will I not be able to take my grandchild in my arms before I die?

00:49:16.943 --> 00:49:17.823
You have us.

00:49:18.579 --> 00:49:19.550
It's different.

00:49:19.882 --> 00:49:22.529
But why, Grandma? Are we not your grandchildren?

00:49:22.896 --> 00:49:27.045
Look how these little donkeys are pretending to not understand what I mean.

00:49:27.295 --> 00:49:32.186
Grandma, let me speak for myself. A week has 7 days and I spend eight days to understand this issue.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.074
Just explain, brother.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.499
I'm not talking about that you hooligan!

00:49:39.252 --> 00:49:43.162
You've had enough time collecting flowers. Start harvesting some honey!

00:49:45.501 --> 00:49:49.813
When you say that Grandma, I feel like a calf breeder.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.687
It is true that you're a calf breeder.

00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:56.213
Also, my brother comes before me, when it comes to this.

00:49:56.434 --> 00:49:59.296
We have to follow the order when it comes to marriage.

00:50:00.362 --> 00:50:03.393
Grandma, I do not want to break your heart, but I've already decided.

00:50:04.688 --> 00:50:05.947
I do not believe in marriage.

00:50:06.246 --> 00:50:06.784
Oh yeah?

00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:11.507
Yes. This love, marriage thing is not for me. Invest in Doruk for that.

00:50:12.373 --> 00:50:15.699
I'll throw this cologne on your heads in a second! Little donkeys.

00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:26.497
Emine.

00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:28.265
Look at this.

00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:29.880
He really is a piece.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.129
He is an architect and comes from a good family.

00:50:34.692 --> 00:50:39.841
If she doesn't find a job, what if she marries him and wont have to return home huh?

00:50:43.289 --> 00:50:44.463
Oh forget it Fadik.

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:50.102
She told me on the phone that received a job but I don't believe it.

00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:54.483
I will find a good guy when we return home.

00:50:54.773 --> 00:51:00.051
You can't say no and lose this boy. Look, such a gentleman.

00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.785
Give, let me see.

00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:07.931
Look.

00:51:09.627 --> 00:51:13.381
Oh, good. Not bad.

00:51:15.475 --> 00:51:17.466
Let them meet first eh?

00:51:17.606 --> 00:51:18.970
It would be best.

00:51:19.517 --> 00:51:21.740
It is impossible not to like him.

00:51:21.959 --> 00:51:24.635
You're funny.

00:51:24.886 --> 00:51:26.787
Why are you laughing?

00:51:28.435 --> 00:51:30.202
He looks like a good boy.

00:51:30.202 --> 00:51:31.754
Look, look, give zoom.

00:51:37.737 --> 00:51:38.806
Why are you laughing?

00:51:38.806 --> 00:51:39.936
I'm laughing at you.

00:51:41.886 --> 00:51:43.423
Such a gentleman.

00:51:45.542 --> 00:51:49.994
I just wanted a job. A job! I didn't want to be involved in the world of crime.

00:51:50.226 --> 00:51:51.821
What do we do now?

00:51:52.035 --> 00:51:58.653
For identity fraud, you'll l get 5 years. Know that I can't visit everyday, I can be occupied.

00:52:00.562 --> 00:52:02.873
I will visit. my friend, do not worry.

00:52:03.331 --> 00:52:09.717
I will not even sleep in my free days just to visit you.

00:52:09.813 --> 00:52:12.686
It will also bring clean clothes and books.

00:52:13.066 --> 00:52:15.721
As they say, count the days and it will pass quickly.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.900
Can you stop mocking me and give me advice?

00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:24.063
What do I do? Shall I be Suna or stay as Hayat? What shall I do?

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:33.067
It's not a problem. You can go to prison and return but if you go home, you will basically be in prison at home.

00:52:34.864 --> 00:52:40.525
I think it is best to be honest and when you go to work tomorrow, say "I'm not Suna".

00:52:41.348 --> 00:52:48.145
Tell them you're not Suna. If you explain them clearly, they will definitely still give you the job.

00:52:48.348 --> 00:52:51.299
Why? Because you're honest.

00:52:54.802 --> 00:52:57.614
Sure, they will give a medal too, right?

00:53:00.003 --> 00:53:06.274
Do not be stupid, Hayat! You have to go to work tomorrow as Suna or aunt Emine will take you home!

00:53:06.707 --> 00:53:10.993
So what? You will find a job. It's not like there are no other jobs left.

00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:15.321
And also... aunt Emine is very sympathetic and understanding.

00:53:18.235 --> 00:53:20.863
Your hometown is very beautiful.

00:53:23.605 --> 00:53:30.578
I do not wanna go to jail or go back home. Especially, I do not want to work with a man so cocky and annoying.

00:53:32.897 --> 00:53:38.856
Come on, girl, you have got a great job and start tomorrow. What else do you want?

00:53:39.874 --> 00:53:42.452
Come, let's arrange something for you to wear.

00:53:43.036 --> 00:53:44.773
Can we have the cheque please?

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:52.740
So brother... Has your assistant started work today?

00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:56.485
Your sudden concern about my work is very tearing, Mr. Doruk.

00:53:56.577 --> 00:53:58.796
Oh it's difficult to sat anything to you.

00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:02.485
I would like to choose my own assistant, but the order comes from above.

00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:07.140
Dude, don't exaggerate. All in all he's our father and he asked of something from you.

00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:09.079
Oh boy, the problem is not father. It's the girl.

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:19.711
The girl is absurd. Her comments are unnecessary and she argues all the time.

00:54:20.879 --> 00:54:24.744
How cool! That's perfect. She's just for you.

00:54:27.104 --> 00:54:29.653
Anyway, you still haven't told me if she's beautiful.

00:54:29.953 --> 00:54:30.729
I don't know.

00:54:30.958 --> 00:54:32.002
"I don't know"?

00:54:32.175 --> 00:54:33.768
I don't know, I never looked at her that way.

00:54:39.052 --> 00:54:43.872
Okay, tell me honestly, it he hansome or not?

00:54:44.605 --> 00:54:45.727
As if I care...

00:54:46.135 --> 00:54:48.877
Also, why am I worried is completely different to why you're worried, Asli

00:54:49.468 --> 00:54:50.772
I think Asli's right.

00:54:51.074 --> 00:54:54.125
Besides, grumpy men are in trend now.

00:54:54.744 --> 00:54:57.728
If everything works, you can come back with a lover. Huh?

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:05.391
I don't want a boyfriend like him, not even a garbage can like him. Plus I can't love a cranky man like him.

00:55:06.009 --> 00:55:06.762
Snob.

00:55:07.762 --> 00:55:09.046
And also she's also spoiled.

00:55:09.771 --> 00:55:11.013
Lord thinks he knows everything.

00:55:11.695 --> 00:55:12.695
She's annoying.

00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:15.557
Total selfish egoist.

00:55:17.405 --> 00:55:20.336
Nothing will change, even if she is beautiful.

00:55:30.973 --> 00:55:32.546
What position does he have?

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.675
What more could he be than an errand boy?

00:55:37.527 --> 00:55:45.752
We met in a lift and he says "That's my job". I wouldn't be lowered. "This is my job. I'm a head assistant."

00:55:47.319 --> 00:55:49.542
Good response.

00:55:50.757 --> 00:55:52.908
What? You didn't you say that you're the boss?

00:55:53.395 --> 00:55:54.967
Let's say I didn't have the opportunity.

00:55:55.438 --> 00:55:57.761
So the news is going to explode tomorrow.

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:02.368
Not this. Why do all the problems find me?

00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:03.156
Who is it?

00:56:03.156 --> 00:56:04.040
Didem!

00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:05.162
Why don't you pick up?

00:56:05.194 --> 00:56:09.088
She doesn't understand. She knows this is our man to man night, yet calls 7 times.

00:56:09.279 --> 00:56:12.468
Dude, I do not understand why you get troubled by this. Give it to me, I'll solve this.

00:56:13.424 --> 00:56:15.044
What are you doing, Dido?

00:56:15.946 --> 00:56:17.090
I'm fine too.

00:56:17.496 --> 00:56:19.034
We were just talking about you.

00:56:19.758 --> 00:56:23.472
A person appears when talking about them, right? Look, we're going to the club.

00:56:24.294 --> 00:56:25.835
Why don't you come?

00:56:26.635 --> 00:56:29.406
Look, my brother says he is waiting for you.

00:56:30.711 --> 00:56:34.249
Okay dear, bye bye.

00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:39.632
She says 'Hi and don't worry, she's on her way and will be here as soon as she can.'

00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:42.451
I am very pleased with your efforts.

00:56:42.893 --> 00:56:45.798
We can say it's revenge for the morning.

00:56:46.974 --> 00:56:49.676
I do not want to stay under the same roof with this man.

00:56:49.894 --> 00:56:54.578
Even breathe the same air as him in the atmosphere, but I have to. It's my job.

00:56:55.681 --> 00:56:57.843
Anyway, that's not the subject right now.

00:56:58.383 --> 00:57:02.393
Girls, I'll start work as a rich man's daughter. What will I wear?

00:57:02.482 --> 00:57:06.683
I only have 2 pairs of shoes and my wardrobe is filled with cheap clothes.

00:57:10.837 --> 00:57:14.064
Do not worry about shoes, I'll fix that.

00:57:15.729 --> 00:57:17.989
I'm wondering if you're going to give her your nurse shoes.

00:57:18.061 --> 00:57:19.237
I said I'll fix it.

00:57:20.743 --> 00:57:22.248
One moment.

00:57:39.563 --> 00:57:43.213
Girl, what have you done? You've literally kept treasure hidden in our room!

00:57:43.949 --> 00:57:47.277
What can I do? I love shoes and I thought I would wear them someday so I bought them all!

00:57:49.695 --> 00:57:50.355
Girl...

00:57:51.356 --> 00:57:54.062
You may get a lover with these shoes.

00:57:54.957 --> 00:57:57.157
But hardly leave the hospital, how can you have a boyfriend?

00:57:57.493 --> 00:58:01.203
Maybe you could cure a patient...

00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:07.841
Or you can find someone sick and make him diseased with love.

00:58:08.717 --> 00:58:12.076
Quit messing around with me. Right now the subject is Hayat.

00:58:14.232 --> 00:58:18.658
Okay, girl, I could not wear these, but you can. Try them on, let's see.

00:58:29.669 --> 00:58:30.449
How is it?

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.692
It looks very good!

00:58:32.341 --> 00:58:33.032
Very good.

00:58:33.954 --> 00:58:35.064
Really well?

00:58:35.747 --> 00:58:36.677
Great!

00:58:36.968 --> 00:58:39.647
Do not worry, do not worry, you can walk in them.

00:58:53.991 --> 00:58:57.243
I admit, this season's collection is great.

00:58:59.731 --> 00:59:02.389
Do you like the theme, Mr. Doruk or the fact that it's revealing?

00:59:02.431 --> 00:59:04.691
Brother, you know, I like what is natural.

00:59:05.486 --> 00:59:09.729
I have to pay more attention to them, not the outfit.

00:59:10.788 --> 00:59:16.058
See the girl in red? She's so fine. Just letting you know, she's mine.

00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:18.021
Boy, you do not already have three?

00:59:18.951 --> 00:59:25.847
Look, I'm just learning from my brother. The head model of our company is with you, isn't she?

00:59:26.299 --> 00:59:28.249
She is the one trying to create a relationship. We don't have one.

00:59:28.326 --> 00:59:30.727
Hanging out more than one night is a relationship.

00:59:31.755 --> 00:59:35.723
A relationship begins and ends with promises expectations.

00:59:35.868 --> 00:59:37.924
So for you it ends before it starts.

00:59:37.944 --> 00:59:38.605
Exactly.

00:59:44.094 --> 00:59:44.835
Yes.

00:59:46.104 --> 00:59:50.715
I look like a rich man's daughter with a 5 year old shirt and a skirt that I bought it for my aunt's wedding.

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.010
Really, I'm trying to pretend that this skirt doesn't exist. That's how horrible it is.

00:59:56.057 --> 00:59:59.607
It might look better if you open this button.

01:00:01.433 --> 01:00:02.835
No, no, not that.

01:00:03.617 --> 01:00:04.797
I do not want a neckline.

01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:09.911
I climb the career ladder through diligence and my abilities, not with my shirt undone.

01:00:10.288 --> 01:00:14.883
Girl, men are simple creatures .Send simple signals to their brains.

01:00:15.637 --> 01:00:19.918
So it must be more open and you have to know how to use your femininity as an advantage!

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:27.125
Why? People can be successful at work with their brains and skills, understand?

01:00:28.054 --> 01:00:30.354
Of course they can, girls like me can have it.

01:00:30.873 --> 01:00:35.323
But angelic girls have priority ..

01:00:35.888 --> 01:00:44.199
They do not know the capital of Italy, or the number of continents in the world, but they are professional players who control the people.

01:01:03.143 --> 01:01:04.882
And my sister came.

01:01:05.026 --> 01:01:06.601
I will revenge when we leave.

01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:10.181
Hi! Hello dear.

01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:14.296
How is it going, Doruk?

01:01:14.557 --> 01:01:17.018
Dido, please, currently you're blocking my view.

01:01:17.851 --> 01:01:22.131
Doruk dear, can I sit next to Murat or o we have to share a chair?

01:01:22.874 --> 01:01:25.475
Okay, I'm getting up.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.712
The goal is to leave the lovebirds alone.

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:40.002
I'll die before I get to work. I'm dying, finished!

01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:51.159
Girl, can you not breathe shallow? Say "hm" and keep your breath in? Because you look so fine it fits well.

01:01:53.257 --> 01:01:56.404
Miss Nurse, can you not see, her face is blue.

01:01:56.601 --> 01:01:59.774
She will need an oxygen tank. It won't work.

01:02:03.372 --> 01:02:06.733
I wonder if there is something right in my wardrobe.

01:02:07.676 --> 01:02:09.485
There is no doubt.

01:02:10.411 --> 01:02:14.702
Pyjamas, nurse clothes, your grandma's clothes.

01:02:15.706 --> 01:02:18.868
Girl, you have a closet in trend for retirement homes.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.500
You wait. Wait a minute.

01:02:23.617 --> 01:02:26.593
I will return in a moment, in a moment.

01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:44.487
Where are we going, dear?

01:02:45.426 --> 01:02:46.651
I am going home.

01:02:47.882 --> 01:02:49.173
But, I don't know about Doruk.

01:02:50.126 --> 01:02:53.596
Doruk dear, tell your brother to stay. Who leaves so early?

01:02:53.825 --> 01:02:55.095
Please don't get me involved.

01:03:03.754 --> 01:03:05.592
Call a taxi for Didem, please.

01:03:05.769 --> 01:03:07.777
Immediately. Miss Didem?

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:10.654
See you then.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.848
Ms. Didem, can we get an interview?

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.391
Wow, you just posted her like a package.

01:03:22.869 --> 01:03:26.248
I don't want to say this, but the girl is not normal.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:30.119
Normal people do not come near me.

01:03:33.764 --> 01:03:36.491
This isn't going to work. Whatever we have doesn't look good enough.

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:41.140
I'd better go back home. Get under my blanket in my tracksuits. Live life without this worry.

01:03:41.383 --> 01:03:42.364
What is this torment.

01:03:42.558 --> 01:03:43.446
Wait.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.979
Give me that too.

01:03:47.852 --> 01:03:50.501
I think this would work, it's not that bad.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.811
Ipek, are these your pants? Yes

01:04:03.223 --> 01:04:06.291
Girl, this looks like the perfect size for you.

01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:11.490
Hold it in front of you.

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.529
Great, it seems to fit.

01:04:20.266 --> 01:04:21.555
We solved it!

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:44.423
What time do I come in the morning?

01:04:44.858 --> 01:04:45.845
9 is fine.

01:04:46.197 --> 01:04:47.160
So that's all for today.

01:04:47.673 --> 01:04:48.410
Yes.

01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:51.741
Can I ask you something, because the work is done?

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.245
No need to wait until work ends to ask me.

01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:56.461
But still, we must distinguish between work and friendship.

01:04:58.365 --> 01:04:59.244
Are you okay?

01:05:00.326 --> 01:05:01.040
I'm fine.

01:05:01.593 --> 01:05:02.842
I'm just a little tired.

01:05:03.162 --> 01:05:08.344
Well, if there is a problem, come to me. I do not understand your business, but still

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.974
I am a good listener for issues.

01:05:10.734 --> 01:05:12.233
I know my friend, thank you.

01:05:13.138 --> 01:05:14.998
Take care until tomorrow.

01:05:15.472 --> 01:05:16.169
And you.

01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:17.128
You're a gem.

01:05:17.403 --> 01:05:18.121
Come on.

01:05:36.924 --> 01:05:37.911
Dear!

01:05:38.307 --> 01:05:39.020
Didem?

01:05:42.464 --> 01:05:43.633
My love.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:44.511
What are you doing here?

01:05:45.878 --> 01:05:49.398
I came in different cars, so no paparazzi followed us.

01:05:51.318 --> 01:05:54.457
Look, I'm really tired. You're pushing it on the wrong night.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.190
I'm so offended. Do you think I am that inconsiderate?

01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:04.911
If you are tired, we can take a shower and watch a movie.

01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:13.095
Okay.

01:06:23.869 --> 01:06:30.369
Mother, aunt Fadik, please let me sleep otherwise I will be late for my first day.

01:06:30.493 --> 01:06:31.209
Exactly.

01:06:32.277 --> 01:06:34.065
What kind of job is this?

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:37.107
Your father said,

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:44.185
I should find out what kind of a job this is.

01:06:45.943 --> 01:06:52.169
He said, "Be careful that Hayat doesn't lie about a job".

01:06:54.184 --> 01:07:02.943
He said "What will she do? How much will she earn?"

01:07:04.864 --> 01:07:10.497
I've already understood that from before, now please let me sleep.

01:07:14.924 --> 01:07:16.931
What position do you have there?

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:19.436
One of the soon to be CEO's assistant's assistant.

01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:20.973
Don't try lying.

01:07:21.075 --> 01:07:24.426
What kind of position is that? Assistant's assistant's assistant?

01:07:25.761 --> 01:07:29.887
I'm not making anything up mother, you'll see when I get my salary.

01:07:30.189 --> 01:07:32.903
Transportation and food is included, right?

01:07:32.919 --> 01:07:34.606
They provide it, right?

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.008
It covers Fadik aunt, everything is included.

01:07:40.267 --> 01:07:43.817
What does this company do, ie, what's the sector?

01:07:44.236 --> 01:07:48.166
The sector is fashion and textile, mother, they make clothes.

01:07:49.226 --> 01:07:51.476
How long have they been established? Are they stable?

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.198
This year they have their 40th anniversary.

01:07:58.755 --> 01:08:01.465
They certainly will have a celebration for the 40 years.

01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:03.912
That is possible.

01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:10.041
What is their profit like?

01:08:12.164 --> 01:08:14.806
I mean, what value do their stocks have?

01:08:16.727 --> 01:08:25.854
I mean, have they invested? What are their dreams? Tell me which way next?

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:28.934
Why are you laughing?

01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:31.899
How could I not laugh, aunt Fadik?

01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:35.897
I didn't buy the company, I just work there.

01:08:36.759 --> 01:08:45.410
My daughter, my child, don't say that. If the company goes bankrupt, you'll be jobless.

01:08:46.112 --> 01:08:47.943
I mean, your father asks, that's why I asked.

01:08:49.773 --> 01:08:55.725
He asked me about the profit margin and said we should reconsider after looking at stock prices.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:09:06.563
Tell him Hayat said 'Don't worry, she has a great job which she could lose tomorrow because you questioned me.

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:08.399
Ok good night.

01:09:14.668 --> 01:09:15.654
She's right.

01:11:50.517 --> 01:11:51.746
Look, be strong...

01:11:51.863 --> 01:11:55.445
But do not let anyone crush you. Do what you need to do at work, but don't over work.

01:11:55.753 --> 01:11:57.604
Browse for your rights, but don't you dare....

01:11:57.615 --> 01:11:58.930
get fired

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.229
As your father said that he will not give you another chance if you get fired.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.281
And he said he would come and take you here and that's it.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.921
And what do you say, Mom?

01:12:09.299 --> 01:12:10.750
What should I say, my daughter?

01:12:10.978 --> 01:12:14.350
No, I mean what do you expect from me?

01:12:15.063 --> 01:12:16.355
What could I expect, my girl?

01:12:16.557 --> 01:12:19.525
I want you to be good, healthy and happy.

01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:21.079
What else can a mother want?

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.461
But if I go back there, I wont be fine and happy mother.

01:12:25.739 --> 01:12:28.575
Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying this because I look down at that place.

01:12:28.582 --> 01:12:29.883
I love my hometown.

01:12:31.466 --> 01:12:35.105
But if I go back there, it is clear of the life that is waiting for me.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.387
At least, that's not the life I dream of.

01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:46.521
That life is not this life, Mom.

01:12:48.778 --> 01:12:50.489
At least, don't do that to me.

01:12:53.982 --> 01:12:55.689
Come here.

01:13:01.635 --> 01:13:04.498
My child... my child.

01:13:09.074 --> 01:13:10.075
Okay, okay.

01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:12.169
I promise I will not be fired.

01:13:12.359 --> 01:13:14.374
Say hi to Dad for me, okay?

01:13:14.461 --> 01:13:15.203
I'm late!

01:13:15.662 --> 01:13:17.102
I'm really late!

01:13:22.923 --> 01:13:24.374
Why did not you wake me up?

01:13:25.452 --> 01:13:27.920
What happened to her?

01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:29.273
She overslept.

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:32.506
Come on.

01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:38.331
My beautiful daughter.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.306
See you.

01:14:22.967 --> 01:14:24.030
Miss Suna?

01:14:26.492 --> 01:14:27.678
I said Suna.

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:30.156
Are you talking to me?

01:14:30.622 --> 01:14:32.909
Is there any other Suna's here?

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.207
I do not know, probably not I guess.

01:14:35.665 --> 01:14:37.917
Mr. Nejat waiting for you in his office.

01:14:38.003 --> 01:14:38.821
Mr. Nejat?

01:14:40.146 --> 01:14:41.541
Nejat Sarslimaz.

01:14:41.905 --> 01:14:45.966
Big boss, the one who is your dad's friend?

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.359
That's right!

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:50.449
Mr. Nejat...

01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:52.854
Nejat uncle...

01:14:53.497 --> 01:14:55.176
He is my father's friend.

01:14:55.637 --> 01:14:56.860
The office is in the last room in the corridor.

01:14:58.679 --> 01:15:05.162
Would not it be better to establish me in my office first, to know my colleagues?

01:15:05.847 --> 01:15:08.989
I mean, it's not a good first impression to the boss, if I seem so free.

01:15:10.043 --> 01:15:11.217
No, you can not.

01:15:12.498 --> 01:15:15.160
I mean, you can not postpone it. He wanted to see you as soon as you came.

01:15:19.435 --> 01:15:21.127
So it is required.

01:15:23.547 --> 01:15:25.414
There is no escape, I suppose.

01:15:28.975 --> 01:15:31.128
Okay, then I'll go.

01:15:32.073 --> 01:15:33.023
From here?

01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:35.018
From here.

01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:42.856
I don't know what is going on in her head.

01:15:52.139 --> 01:15:53.776
Welcome, Mr. Murat.

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:57.215
Are these the new ones?

01:15:57.492 --> 01:15:58.425
Yes, sir.

01:16:00.183 --> 01:16:01.610
Did you organise a meeting with the designers?

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.263
Yes sir, they will be here at 11.

01:16:03.349 --> 01:16:04.580
Bring me a double espresso.

01:16:04.596 --> 01:16:05.700
Before breakfast, sir?

01:16:06.102 --> 01:16:08.400
If I wanted breakfast, I'd ask. Do you understand Cagla?

01:16:12.322 --> 01:16:14.736
How nice, we will be tortured by you today.

01:16:22.312 --> 01:16:23.590
Help me, Lord.

01:16:25.476 --> 01:16:27.018
Come in, please.

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:31.445
Come, my girl.

01:16:32.647 --> 01:16:35.635
So you're Kemal's daughter?

01:16:36.771 --> 01:16:39.067
It is something you could say, yes.

01:16:40.316 --> 01:16:41.862
Just like her father, great!

01:16:42.577 --> 01:16:43.534
Come, sit down.

01:16:43.987 --> 01:16:45.675
I do not want to bother you.

01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:51.249
Why would you bother me, my daughter, come and talk to me a little about your father.

01:16:53.281 --> 01:16:54.198
so...

01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:56.644
We couldn't talk much on the phone.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.894
Tell me, what is he doing?

01:16:59.946 --> 01:17:02.299
Actually... I ..

01:17:02.725 --> 01:17:04.719
But how would you know, right?

01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:07.980
He's spent most of the year in Cape Town, how great!

01:17:13.572 --> 01:17:14.499
So what?

01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.742
How much longer until he retires?

01:17:18.304 --> 01:17:19.506
Wait, what did he say?

01:17:19.873 --> 01:17:21.410
He said something like this year being his last.

01:17:22.632 --> 01:17:23.681
So it seems.

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:32.264
He should remarry. Derya and I have said many times, after your mother died, but he refuses.

01:17:33.157 --> 01:17:34.482
He has lived his life alone.

01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:39.047
Is it not normal when the pain of losing my mother is so fresh?

01:17:39.883 --> 01:17:41.407
20 years have passed, my girl.

01:17:42.331 --> 01:17:43.161
Is that so?

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.882
Has it been so long?

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.030
Time flies so fast, Uncle Nejat.

01:17:52.789 --> 01:17:53.730
That is true.

01:17:54.601 --> 01:17:59.366
For example, I have not seen since you were 5 years.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.455
But before, were you not blonde?

01:18:03.498 --> 01:18:05.957
Oh this! It's dye. I'm still blonde.

01:18:08.009 --> 01:18:12.080
Anyway, I will not bother you anymore and anger your boss.

01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:14.757
My boss?

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.987
Your father never told you?

01:18:19.007 --> 01:18:22.012
I'm slowly leaving all my work for my sons

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:34.755
So he's grumpy again. If he won't throw this espresso at me, I'll be surprised.

01:18:35.263 --> 01:18:36.109
Miss Suna!

01:18:37.167 --> 01:18:39.118
Perfect, perfect timing.

01:18:39.989 --> 01:18:41.318
Mr Murat awaits you.

01:18:41.866 --> 01:18:43.539
Come one after another.

01:18:46.665 --> 01:18:47.983
Who is Mr. Murat?

01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:49.839
The elder son of Mr. Nejat.

01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:54.033
He's very sweet. In fact, in the mornings, he's like a marshmallow.

01:18:54.995 --> 01:18:57.461
He asked for an espresso. I thought you could start there.

01:18:57.549 --> 01:18:59.346
In fact from now, this is your job.

01:18:59.495 --> 01:19:00.938
The room opposite here.

01:19:01.205 --> 01:19:02.967
Hurry, hurry, run.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.610
Run.

01:19:16.175 --> 01:19:16.801
Enter.

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:20.315
You can put it on the table, Cagla.

01:19:21.066 --> 01:19:24.264
Cagla, I mean, Ms. Cagla asked me to bring me coffee.

01:19:55.651 --> 01:19:58.192
Enough. This is too much.

01:19:58.668 --> 01:19:59.694
What are you doing here?

01:20:00.284 --> 01:20:01.853
I've told you, this is my work place.

01:20:02.035 --> 01:20:04.549
I understand that much. What are you doing in Mr Murat's office?

01:20:04.906 --> 01:20:07.402
What are these positions, hands in pockets, in front of the window?

01:20:08.534 --> 01:20:09.544
I'm Murat.

01:20:09.857 --> 01:20:13.615
And so what? If you ask 10 people on the street, two of them will say they are Murat.

01:20:14.545 --> 01:20:19.119
Just because you have the same name, does not mean you can enter the boss's office.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:33.309
Oh. You, I mean, you're that Murat.

01:20:36.405 --> 01:20:37.720
Murat the boss.

01:20:41.196 --> 01:20:43.720
Exactly, can you give me my coffee now?

01:20:46.872 --> 01:20:48.448
I apologize.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.714
I'm really sorry.

01:20:51.695 --> 01:20:54.905
If I knew, I would not be so...

01:20:55.195 --> 01:20:57.158
But you didn't make it obvious that you were Mr Murat.

01:20:58.393 --> 01:21:00.095
Thanks for the warning.

01:21:00.808 --> 01:21:04.602
From now on, I'll walk around, telling everyone I am Murat Sarsilmaz.

01:21:05.435 --> 01:21:07.080
No, that's not what I meant.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.468
Well, the discussion is over.

01:21:08.549 --> 01:21:09.432
Suna, right?

01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:10.316
No, Hayat.

01:21:11.813 --> 01:21:12.366
How?

01:21:13.166 --> 01:21:16.285
I mean, my name legally is Suna Pektas.

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.994
In my private life, I prefer to be called Hayat.

01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:22.682
My father does not know.

01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:26.005
I don't want him to think I don't like the name he gave me.

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:29.823
Okay, let's not extend this.

01:21:29.859 --> 01:21:30.717
Yeah sure.

01:21:32.069 --> 01:21:35.373
The fact that you got this job because of your father means nothing to me.

01:21:35.587 --> 01:21:38.222
Indifference is what I hate the workplace.

01:21:38.438 --> 01:21:41.490
Therefore, in my eyes, you're not Suna Pektas, but simply an employee.

01:21:41.787 --> 01:21:42.973
That's exactly what I am.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:44.418
Please do not cut me off while I'm talking.

01:21:50.101 --> 01:21:50.868
Yes.

01:21:52.661 --> 01:21:53.299
Yes, what?

01:21:53.994 --> 01:21:56.295
You said not to cut you off, and stopped talking.

01:21:56.526 --> 01:21:58.165
Oh, so you can't do work without an order.

01:21:58.927 --> 01:22:00.382
You can leave now.

01:22:16.689 --> 01:22:20.805
So, said epitome of selfishness, polar bear, turned out to be my boss, Asli, look at what you're saying.

01:22:21.176 --> 01:22:25.693
Why are you upset? I'm just saying that every great romance begins with a fight.

01:22:25.694 --> 01:22:30.344
Well, that was used in a sense of chasing. It's been hundreds of years since that saying was used darling.

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:34.624
In Hayat's case, she will end up chasing after him, he is her boss. It will be bad

01:22:34.813 --> 01:22:38.667
Thanks, girls, you're being really useful. What am I supposed to do now?

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.411
It's not just a lie, but suffering that is connected to this job. I say quit.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:48.252
Don't you dare Hayat. You know what will happen if you do.

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:50.372
Living a life with a lie is wrong.

01:22:50.372 --> 01:22:53.339
Life is wrong without lies anyway.

01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:59.424
Also, there is no such thing as a good boss, only hard working employees.

01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:06.651
You're exactly and hour and a half late for the rehearsal.

01:23:07.657 --> 01:23:09.933
And you care only care about makeup, darling Didem?

01:23:10.363 --> 01:23:13.014
Look at me, Tuval, for God's sake, look at me.

01:23:13.206 --> 01:23:14.367
Turn, let me see.

01:23:14.437 --> 01:23:14.976
Look.

01:23:17.869 --> 01:23:18.494
Yes.

01:23:19.456 --> 01:23:23.066
You really look like a rotten model that was forgotten in the warehouse.

01:23:23.477 --> 01:23:26.541
Thanks, Tuval, you're really morale.

01:23:27.181 --> 01:23:29.877
I do not work in team morale.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:37.764
I'm chief designer of this great company, I'm with you right now because I want to do my work on time.

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:41.444
There is no way I can face people like this.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:44.097
Do not push me, Tuval. I'm very tired, do not push me.

01:23:45.861 --> 01:23:49.941
Tell me what happened? Did you carry a heavy weighing bag in the morning?

01:23:51.082 --> 01:23:55.678
Last night I was at Murat's home. We slept really late.

01:23:57.222 --> 01:24:06.475
I'm not interested in your private life. I don't think it concerns Murat either. If you can try on this seasons creations before the next season, it would be great.

01:24:14.469 --> 01:24:16.645
So what are you going to do?

01:24:17.184 --> 01:24:21.325
First I'm going to wash my face with cold water. I think my blood pressure rose.

01:24:21.353 --> 01:24:26.964
And tell your boss "mmm, you may look fine, but you have no personality."

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:32.003
Don't you dare ruin your decency. Besides, who are you to judge someone's personality?

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:33.754
All right, girls, I'm closing the phone.

01:24:40.662 --> 01:24:42.721
Honey, can you give me two tissues, please?

01:24:48.691 --> 01:24:51.925
Simply put them on my neck, I don't want powder everywhere.

01:24:56.376 --> 01:24:57.228
Merci.

01:24:59.852 --> 01:25:02.515
Slowly, I don't want to get water to splash my dress

01:25:04.491 --> 01:25:05.645
Do you have any other orders?

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:13.272
I did not have breakfast. Get me fresh orange juice and yogurt with cereal, but no fruit pieces.

01:25:13.527 --> 01:25:15.747
For god's sake, look at you.

01:25:15.827 --> 01:25:17.309
I can't look, my mascara hasn't dried.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.371
Hurry! What are you waiting for?

01:25:21.882 --> 01:25:23.465
Do you know who I am?

01:25:25.685 --> 01:25:26.363
No.

01:25:27.679 --> 01:25:30.265
Murat Sarslimaz's assistant's assistant.

01:25:31.283 --> 01:25:35.241
Is that so? I'm Murat Sarsilmaz's girlfriend.

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:40.402
To my knowledge, there is no position of being the 'boss's girlfriend'.

01:25:40.648 --> 01:25:43.607
I am also the face of this company, dear.

01:25:43.934 --> 01:25:46.347
Now the stones are falling into place.

01:25:48.488 --> 01:25:51.661
What rock are you talking about?

01:25:52.099 --> 01:25:57.261
Say, to serve dolls like you, is not part of the job description.

01:25:57.598 --> 01:26:00.629
Find your own curier. Have a good day!

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.166
Look at her.

01:26:16.055 --> 01:26:16.850
Doruk.

01:26:17.738 --> 01:26:18.830
Doruk, wake up.

01:26:19.266 --> 01:26:20.451
Wake up, Doruk.

01:26:20.923 --> 01:26:24.070
Mom, I feel asleep towards the morning, please let me sleep.

01:26:24.157 --> 01:26:27.610
Everything that happened to us is because you sleep every morning.

01:26:31.768 --> 01:26:33.073
What has happened to us?

01:26:33.427 --> 01:26:34.292
You do not see that, right?

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:38.365
You look pretty good.

01:26:39.388 --> 01:26:42.060
Son, you're not aware of anything?

01:26:43.805 --> 01:26:50.049
Mother would it not be better if you put aside the questions and you talk more openly?

01:26:51.316 --> 01:26:57.997
Your brother is at work. Your dad is creating a program for his retirement and you're at home sleeping.

01:26:58.394 --> 01:26:59.455
Is that not great?

01:27:00.526 --> 01:27:03.145
Everything is in order. Perfect.

01:27:04.604 --> 01:27:10.184
You are going to get out of that bed immediately, take a shower and go to work.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:15.007
Doruk Look, you owe me this. I swear I will not tolerate this.

01:27:16.406 --> 01:27:18.060
Okay, okay, okay.

01:27:18.602 --> 01:27:19.468
Calm down.

01:27:21.546 --> 01:27:22.712
Just relax.

01:27:24.423 --> 01:27:26.198
Is it possible you're going through menopause?

01:27:26.973 --> 01:27:27.742
Doruk

01:27:28.015 --> 01:27:29.547
She probably has.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:46.645
The agent expects photos to tie to the magazine.

01:27:46.712 --> 01:27:47.945
Catalog, speed, agent, photographs.

01:27:53.445 --> 01:27:55.012
Why are you waiting here?

01:27:55.714 --> 01:27:58.848
If I say, for the bus, this conversation will extend.

01:28:05.963 --> 01:28:07.667
I'm waiting for a task.

01:28:08.955 --> 01:28:10.503
Why were you hired?

01:28:10.954 --> 01:28:13.019
To support your assistant.

01:28:13.301 --> 01:28:15.091
Then help my assistant.

01:28:29.452 --> 01:28:32.165
Did you tell the sector that we are looking for young designers?

01:28:32.262 --> 01:28:33.188
I advertised, sir.

01:28:35.024 --> 01:28:37.236
If I wanted advertising, I would have said.

01:28:39.332 --> 01:28:41.571
Advertising was not needed. He would have said so.

01:28:42.088 --> 01:28:45.143
I need experienced young designers.

01:28:46.183 --> 01:28:47.358
We know what we need.

01:28:47.712 --> 01:28:51.571
Look at the staff of the rival companies. Offer jobs.

01:28:51.761 --> 01:28:53.022
Are we going to steal staff?

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.036
I mean, it is not shameful?

01:29:10.466 --> 01:29:13.611
In addition, why would they work for you if they already have good jobs?

01:29:17.344 --> 01:29:22.795
Ms. Cagla, please tell your assistant she's not here to question my orders, but to execute them.

01:29:24.021 --> 01:29:26.428
Because if she can't work without orders, she can at least listen.

01:29:28.265 --> 01:29:30.180
Don't question. Execute. Learn to listen.

01:29:33.686 --> 01:29:35.320
I wonder if he would die if I was to give him an order.

01:29:43.276 --> 01:29:44.700
What is the winter collection's situation?

01:29:44.705 --> 01:29:45.948
Designers are going to finish, sir.

01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:47.504
But we're still in June.

01:29:50.786 --> 01:29:51.982
What did I say?

01:29:52.397 --> 01:29:54.102
What is the winter collection's situation?

01:29:54.523 --> 01:29:59.082
What did I say along the way? Since you're not taking notes and questioning me, I think you rely on your memory too much.

01:30:07.196 --> 01:30:09.688
Did you tell the sector that we are looking for young designers?

01:30:09.885 --> 01:30:11.764
If I wanted advertising, I would have said.

01:30:12.064 --> 01:30:19.071
I need young designers and experienced staff . Research our rivals.

01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.813
Let little Miss make the adaptation process.

01:30:27.933 --> 01:30:28.714
What is that?

01:30:29.634 --> 01:30:36.410
In short, running from floor to floor jobs. Find Edil on the second floor, she will tell you what to do.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:27.496
I would have gave him a piece of my mind if I had not needed this job. I wonder how it would have been if I didn't have an influence from my 'father'. What a sadist.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.989
Watch where you're going.

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:31.470
Was it just me?

01:31:32.786 --> 01:31:37.287
Excuse me, I got angry at someone else and took my anger out on you.

01:31:37.461 --> 01:31:40.250
Let me guess, the centre of your anger is from Murat Sarslimaz.

01:31:40.731 --> 01:31:44.070
Perfect guess. What strange person is he?

01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:47.134
I do not know what the problem is but he enjoys taking his anger out on others.

01:31:47.433 --> 01:31:52.419
He gains power through torture. It's a hard case. After examining him, it would take three years to diagnose his illness.

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:55.297
Okay, so he's just like that at work.

01:31:56.222 --> 01:32:00.594
I don't think so. Whatever someone is, they will remain forever. Anyone who said else is a liar.

01:32:01.119 --> 01:32:04.550
Nobody said it, I speak from experience.

01:32:06.138 --> 01:32:07.794
You two are friends?

01:32:08.555 --> 01:32:09.681
Somehow.

01:32:11.764 --> 01:32:14.083
Please do not tell me that you are more than that, god forbid.

01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:16.941
It happens to be my big brother.

01:32:23.923 --> 01:32:25.467
See, this isn't good now.

01:32:25.955 --> 01:32:30.134
No, it's not a problem. Sometimes my brother deserves these words.

01:32:30.657 --> 01:32:32.925
Although, I congratulate you for your courage.

01:32:33.789 --> 01:32:35.119
Doruk Sarslimaz.

01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:37.877
Suna Pektas, but I like to use the name Hayat.

01:32:54.306 --> 01:32:56.597
How could two people be so different Ipek?

01:32:56.676 --> 01:32:58.389
How are they from the same parents?

01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.515
It isn't though. They have different mothers.

01:33:01.985 --> 01:33:08.266
One is actually a person, the other is a zoo escapee. I went up and down stairs because of him!

01:33:08.436 --> 01:33:09.756
Just think about the money?

01:33:10.332 --> 01:33:15.874
I will not get any money because I will quit. Mom is already back in town. I'll just look for another job.

01:33:16.068 --> 01:33:17.110
You can not find one.

01:33:17.404 --> 01:33:20.830
Girl, why you can not say something nice? I will find a job.

01:33:22.588 --> 01:33:29.680
If my name is Hayat Uzun, I will find another job.

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.158
It's over.

01:33:31.777 --> 01:33:32.802
Go Hayat!

01:33:34.582 --> 01:33:35.729
Hayat go.

01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:46.263
Has Asli come home early?

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:47.356
I don't know.

01:33:57.335 --> 01:33:58.418
Welcome.

01:34:01.596 --> 01:34:02.480
Mother?

01:34:03.418 --> 01:34:05.011
Did not you leave in the morning?

01:34:05.237 --> 01:34:12.709
Your father told me to stay. He said 'With that sharp tongue, no one will keep her for longer than a week.

01:34:12.993 --> 01:34:20.084
'Sit and wait. Either she will get fired, or have enough and quit. Then the next day you will get her and come'.

01:34:22.553 --> 01:34:23.783
He must have said it.

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:53.238
Have a little mercy, look at how old I am.

01:34:53.954 --> 01:35:00.225
You could outrun everyone, Nejat Sarslimaz. We don't have mercy. Empathy? None.

01:35:01.585 --> 01:35:04.125
Look at this hooligan.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.667
Where did you learn this phrase?

01:35:07.787 --> 01:35:09.168
In "Hababam Sinifi".

01:35:10.975 --> 01:35:19.878
That film is all about you: mischief, diabolical luck, escaping from your job. Everything is there.

01:35:25.424 --> 01:35:27.615
Who's winning? I'll choose my side according to it.

01:35:28.659 --> 01:35:32.621
Come on son, your brother is beating me.

01:35:33.341 --> 01:35:35.562
Surprise me once, Nejat.

01:35:36.301 --> 01:35:40.505
But Dad, even with my brother, the results will not change.

01:35:41.216 --> 01:35:43.174
I can beat you both.

01:35:43.361 --> 01:35:46.813
Remember, Doruk, who laughs last, laughs best.

01:35:51.606 --> 01:35:53.633
You can not win every game.

01:35:54.327 --> 01:35:55.386
Pot.

01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:04.956
But it depends on one thing.

01:36:06.382 --> 01:36:08.286
What is it? I'm curious.

01:36:08.902 --> 01:36:11.319
Only if the winner is not my brother.

01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:24.120
Guys, then, whoever catches this one, wins.

01:36:29.595 --> 01:36:34.515
If the mother discovers what I've been doing, she would crush me like hazelnuts in shell, without any mercy.

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:39.392
Frankly, my dear, I think you should tell the truth.

01:36:39.808 --> 01:36:45.643
I mean, when you explained in this morning, she was softer and listened to you.

01:36:46.525 --> 01:36:51.294
This is Aunt Emine. If you marinaded her in kindness for 3 days, she wouldn't soften.

01:36:51.613 --> 01:36:53.387
Who has died of sincerity?

01:36:53.954 --> 01:36:56.373
Truth can not always be said.

01:36:56.794 --> 01:37:01.941
Girls, don't start again. It doesn't matter if I tell or not, this will explode in my face someday.

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.910
Exactly.

01:37:05.893 --> 01:37:06.872
It won't.

01:37:07.079 --> 01:37:11.268
The girl knows 4 languages! 4! My English is this: Alright, Okay, Yes, No.

01:37:12.036 --> 01:37:14.936
There isn't a place she hasn't been and I do not even have a passport.

01:37:16.688 --> 01:37:23.860
That human misery will not ask for anything but work anyway but if I face Mr Nejat, I don't know what I'd do.

01:37:24.448 --> 01:37:29.333
Plus, just looking at her social media will be enough.

01:37:29.564 --> 01:37:36.984
You're lucky that you don't have to get plastic surgery. She hasn't posted photo's of her online and any other accounts are private.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:42.887
You sly fox, for the past 2 hours, you've been inspecting her social media accounts?!

01:37:43.282 --> 01:37:46.518
Exactly. I think it's more useful than breaking nuts.

01:37:46.738 --> 01:37:48.926
I love you. Any other information?

01:37:49.484 --> 01:37:50.613
Well, I mean,

01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:55.588
from now on you are an animal lover and addicted to nature.

01:37:55.753 --> 01:37:58.504
Your accounts are full of wings and beaks.

01:38:01.001 --> 01:38:03.564
Girls, I don't think she has a normal brain.

01:38:05.389 --> 01:38:07.117
That is an unknown bird, Suna.

01:38:07.521 --> 01:38:10.314
We must see it.

01:38:10.752 --> 01:38:16.268
It comes once every five years and stays for only 3 days. It is so unknown that it doesn't have a name.

01:38:17.092 --> 01:38:20.329
There is only one thing I know: I'm finished.

01:38:20.726 --> 01:38:22.965
How do I tell my father that I did not get the job.

01:38:24.551 --> 01:38:26.760
Maybe you should leave him a voicemail.

01:38:27.506 --> 01:38:30.645
So far, I lived after my father's wishes.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:38.645
But I've had enough. Just to teach me a lesson, he sent me with that resume for a job as an assistant.

01:38:39.438 --> 01:38:43.671
I'm going to go now and tell him 'It's up to here.' Let him be upset a bit.

01:38:43.671 --> 01:38:44.739
But he has a heart ..

01:38:44.739 --> 01:38:46.332
No, Gokce, he has no heart.

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:56.511
What about my heart broken, Gokce? Who will think of it? This matter will be closed tonight.

01:39:08.328 --> 01:39:09.173
Murat.

01:39:10.062 --> 01:39:13.399
I want back the calories that I've burned.

01:39:13.629 --> 01:39:17.448
This thing known as sports makes me gain weight, son.

01:39:18.235 --> 01:39:21.497
I'm as hungry as a fox again. What should we make?

01:39:21.962 --> 01:39:25.829
Later, okay, Dad? I go home now and get ready for an important meeting tomorrow.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.780
I waited to tell you goodbye.

01:39:28.082 --> 01:39:32.954
Don't go, son. Let work wait. Can life pass like this?

01:39:33.261 --> 01:39:34.225
Work can wait?

01:39:34.941 --> 01:39:37.824
Mr. Nejat, work can't wait, I learnt that from you.

01:39:39.114 --> 01:39:43.243
That is true, but when you're older, your priorities change, son.

01:39:44.299 --> 01:39:46.233
Therefore, I must retire.

01:39:47.319 --> 01:39:53.107
Alright, leave. But, I was going to call Kemal. Maybe you'd like to talk to him before you leave.

01:39:53.597 --> 01:39:55.982
You can share your observations about his daughter in front of him.

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:01.111
It is better if I don't, trust me. Plus you know I don't like to lie.

01:40:01.355 --> 01:40:03.148
So the situation is so bad to explain.

01:40:04.126 --> 01:40:07.333
The girl just started and her resume is good.

01:40:08.483 --> 01:40:12.911
Well, her first performance showed me that I keep my expectations.

01:40:14.124 --> 01:40:15.418
Now excuse me, I gotta go.

01:40:15.562 --> 01:40:16.501
OK Bye.

01:40:17.142 --> 01:40:17.887
But..

01:40:19.685 --> 01:40:22.938
Stay true to your word, you've me promised a meal.

01:40:25.903 --> 01:40:29.347
And I am aware that the student has become the master, Murat.

01:40:30.784 --> 01:40:33.863
I am proud of you, don't forget this.

01:40:42.154 --> 01:40:48.961
My pride, my picture of contentment, I can not tell you how proud I am as a father.

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.177
Dad, I...

01:40:50.409 --> 01:40:57.427
No, no, my child. My little daughter has grown up and got a job!

01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:58.766
Yes, work well ..

01:40:58.868 --> 01:41:00.484
You love it, right?

01:41:00.564 --> 01:41:02.550
Textiles; it's a colored sector?

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.374
Father.

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:06.524
We have to talk.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:16.949
Look who's calling, your uncle Nejat.

01:41:20.225 --> 01:41:21.720
Nejat, how are you?

01:41:22.574 --> 01:41:28.297
Thank you. Suna and I were just talking about you.

01:41:29.782 --> 01:41:33.418
Very nice, very nice.

01:41:35.084 --> 01:41:42.611
Look, that's good, now I feel relieved. I'll arrange it before I leave. Take care.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.893
Did you not get upset?

01:41:48.222 --> 01:41:49.764
On the contrary, I am happy.

01:41:50.634 --> 01:41:52.796
Nejat uncle liked you.

01:41:52.967 --> 01:41:54.014
Nejat uncle...

01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:55.672
Me?

01:41:55.795 --> 01:42:03.456
He said that I grew a fine, respecting little girl. He was really happy with your chat, by the way.

01:42:03.664 --> 01:42:05.452
Our chat?

01:42:05.653 --> 01:42:07.349
Yes, you spoke in the morning.

01:42:20.526 --> 01:42:26.614
I have to go for 30 minutes and until I get back, stay away from important things. Answer the phone, but make no promises.

01:42:29.614 --> 01:42:31.863
And Mr Murat wants to see you, I'm late.

01:42:36.982 --> 01:42:39.982
Let's hope for the best

01:42:54.116 --> 01:42:57.356
It won't take long. Once I find out what is going on, I'll come back.

01:42:57.467 --> 01:43:00.270
What could be going on, dear, maybe your dad misunderstood.

01:43:00.566 --> 01:43:05.921
I left without encountering anyone, so who is that person who has met with Nejat uncle?

01:43:08.074 --> 01:43:10.377
Yes, it is a little odd.

01:43:10.492 --> 01:43:13.030
I will return after I solve the mystery.

01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:24.002
Enter.

01:43:27.232 --> 01:43:28.199
Take this.

01:43:29.443 --> 01:43:30.340
What is this?

01:43:31.465 --> 01:43:33.465
I don't know, I mean, it looks like a key to me.

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.937
I understood that much. I meant what am I supposed to do with it?

01:43:38.666 --> 01:43:43.271
Oh, but I guess, it opens doors.

01:44:48.765 --> 01:44:51.435
This is the key for the archive where old creations are stored.

01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:54.229
So will it stay with me?

01:44:54.724 --> 01:44:55.831
No, you will stay there.

01:44:56.806 --> 01:45:00.236
So after yesterday's torture with the stairs, 
am I going to organise shelves?

01:45:00.454 --> 01:45:04.431
It’s interesting how you see labor as punishment. 
I recommend seeing a therapist.

01:45:22.941 --> 01:45:24.689
I came to see Suna Pektas.

01:45:24.875 --> 01:45:28.144
I saw her going into Mr Murat's office. 
You can wait here if you want.

01:45:28.369 --> 01:45:29.391
Okay, thank you.

01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:46.916
You have to organize the archive.

01:45:47.358 --> 01:45:48.125
Organize?

01:45:49.901 --> 01:45:52.354
Maybe you should see an aurist after therapy.

01:45:53.969 --> 01:45:57.812
Drawings in the first 20 years are in documents.
Transfer them on to the the system.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.175
One by one?

01:45:59.677 --> 01:46:01.266
If you can, take ten out of ten.

01:46:05.945 --> 01:46:07.724
What is your problem with me?

01:46:08.889 --> 01:46:11.216
Well, I know my father said show me mercy.

01:46:12.787 --> 01:46:15.044
This has nothing to do with your father.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.058
So you're saying that this is your overall attitude.

01:46:18.578 --> 01:46:22.559
Look, I don't see a problem and when it comes 
to work I have only one attitude: professionalism.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.303
If you want to be my assistant, you should know what work is.

01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:30.071
I tell you enter files into a system, but you have absolutely no idea about it.

01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:34.120
I repeat: do not ask, execute.

01:46:38.608 --> 01:46:39.406
Fine.

01:46:50.812 --> 01:46:53.602
Do not ask, execute. You have no idea about the world of work.

01:46:53.761 --> 01:46:56.513
You have no idea how to be human, what we do?

01:46:57.114 --> 01:46:59.543
I'm not an assistant here, I'm withstanding torture!

01:46:59.859 --> 01:47:01.709
He is not the boss, he is a demon from hell.

01:47:02.436 --> 01:47:06.166
What evil did I do to get into the hands of this creature?

01:47:06.748 --> 01:47:10.049
Suna probably felt it, that's why she left.

01:47:11.922 --> 01:47:12.602
Hi.

01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:14.772
I came to see my Pektas Call.

01:47:15.216 --> 01:47:16.223
I am Suna Pektas.

01:47:26.402 --> 01:47:28.378
What a coincidence, so am I.

01:47:38.617 --> 01:47:39.649
Miss Suna?

01:47:39.807 --> 01:47:40.606
Yes?

01:47:43.484 --> 01:47:59.908
