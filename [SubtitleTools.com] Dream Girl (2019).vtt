WEBVTT

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.680
- Please.. Please..for my sake..
- No, I won't do it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.200
Please..Karam..
Listen.. Just listen to me once..

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.040
Bro, I have failed again.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.600
And the teacher has asked to speak with
my mother. Please help me out here.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.320
- I won't.
- You can take my chocolates too.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.040
Please..

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.240
- Seriously?
- Yes..

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.120
Okay, fine.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.240
Hello Sir..
Smiley speaking, sir.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.320
The one
who failed the tests miserably.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.320
Sir please talk to my mother.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.560
Yes..

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320
Hello, sir.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.160
What? He failed again.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.080
Nothing to worry.
He will do better next year.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.480
He's a Punjabi boy after all.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.440
Even if he fails again,
there is nothing to worry about..

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.960
..we will sell a plot
and release his music album.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.840
Fine. I'll hang up the phone now.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.120
You're not dressed up yet!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.000
All the other characters
are completely ready!

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.560
I am not going to play Sita.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.800
I've told you before..

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.000
I can play Hanuman or Ram..

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.600
..but you are stuck only at Sita.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.800
Make him Sita instead.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560
Huh..
Punjabi Sita.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.960
Never.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.800
You know how to mimic
a girls voice not me.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040
- Please..
- Stop. Stop..

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.720
Please don't say like this.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600
One last time.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.040
Promise?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Swear on God.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.080
I am not going to play Sita.
I've been saying it for years now.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.280
Don't say that.
Just one last time play Sita.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.040
Next time we'll manage
Ram Leela without Sita.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.520
- Take it.
- Never.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.560
Jambwant, Neel, Jatayu, I am
willing to do anything. But not Sita.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.120
Brother. Mother Sita
is nowhere to be seen.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.040
Ohh..

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920
People don't come to see you,
but to hear your voice.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.920
And all these rewards that you get..

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.600
..you will get them
as long as you play Sita.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.560
And not otherwise.
Understood?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.840
- Sita.
- Mother..

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.720
- Sita!
- Mother..

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.520
- Mom, when will mother Sita show up?
- Soon, son.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.360
Here. Ask Jatayu to put
this on and get ready as Sita.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.560
Wait. Bring it here.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.720
Will you do it.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.920
- Only till I get a job.
- Take this.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920
- Sita!
- Mother..

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.000
Lord..

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.680
Mother Sita has arrived.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.680
Lord!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.280
Lord, you are back!

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.240
- Glory to..
- Mother Sita!

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.160
Once more! Once more!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.120
Mr. Jagjeet..

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.720
Mr. Jagjeet!

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.040
Yes tell me, What all do you want?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
Incense sticks? Urn? Sandalwood?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.880
Instalments!

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.840
Instalments?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.360
How useless can you be?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.560
This is no place
to ask for instalments.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.480
- Instalment of bank loan.
- Which bank loan?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.800
The loan that you
borrowed from the bank.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.560
I've borrowed money from six banks.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680
The bank where you haven't
paid the last three instalments.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.280
But I haven't paid back three banks.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.560
The bank where you mortgaged
your home as collateral.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.800
So be more specific, Mr. Mithilesh.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.240
How else do you expect me to say it?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.840
Everytime when I come here,
you refuse to recognize me.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600
Why don't you pay
your instalments on time?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.240
You know what, Mithilesh,
come back day-after-tomorrow.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.520
- Day-after-tomorrow?
- Yes.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.440
Fine.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.760
But the day after tomorrow is a Sunday.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.920
What?
Day-after-tomorrow is Sunday?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.160
How can this happen?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.120
Then come back on Monday.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.240
- Sure?
- Sure.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.480
Can I pack something
for your family?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.840
You are offering as if
you own a sweet shop.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.080
- Brother, Radhe-Shyam.
- Radhe-Radhe..

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.000
Hey Karam..how about a selfie?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.600
Thank you bro!

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.080
Radhe-Radhe, Karam brother.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.960
Take mother Sita's blessings.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.640
- It's his first day at the school.
- God Bless you.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.360
Greetings, mother Sita.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.680
What an amazing son,
and look at the father.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.720
Mithilesh. Ride your scooter carefully.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.080
Or it may happen that I'll wait
your money and you may never show up.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.440
Finally, you are awake, Mother Sita.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.840
Here are 11,500 rupees.
Go buy yourself a new mobile phone.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.600
Your mother has put in so many
prayers to have you.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.280
But you keep on playing female
characters in your plays.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.640
Portraying the character of Sita
in Ramleela or Radha in Krishnaleela.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.320
I don't care if you dress up as
one of the supporting male characters..

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.440
..but at least it
will make me very happy.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.560
I wonder what your mother would
have said if she was still alive.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.720
Even she was a female.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.440
But you are a male.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.240
Do you have any idea
how much debt I am under?

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.640
This home's mortgaged, the shop's
mortgaged, in fact, even I am mortgaged.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.680
Except the blood bank you've
borrowed money from every bank.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880
Well, son,
borrowing money is not my hobby.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.960
I don't like to go around
borrowing money for a pastime.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.640
If you find a job, then only
will we be able to clear all the debts.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.520
Yes. I am trying.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.720
In fact,
I've given so many interviews..

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.480
..that if now anyone asks for
directions, I narrate my entire resume.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.920
The results will be declared today.
I know I'll get the job.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.640
I sure wish you do, son.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.760
And listen..

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.600
Don't forget to wash your face first.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.560
Doesn't look nice if mother
Sita keeps failing all the time.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.200
Get off at the next stop.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.240
Hey Karam?
Did you go to check your result?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.200
Did you get the job?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.640
Yeah..they want me to replace
Trump in the White House.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.440
- Now take this bus tot he White House.
- Meaning no luck this time either.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.840
Just give me the ticket.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.400
Gokul-Mathura. Gokul-Mathura.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.960
Anybody want ticket.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.840
Give change.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.680
- Please sit.
- No, I am absolutely fine.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.760
All I do is sit at home all day.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.280
- Sit.
- Yes.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.520
Thank you, brother.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.680
How many ticket you want?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.520
'Salary 70,000 per month!'

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.120
These people always
litter government buses.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.120
- Driver, stop the bus!
- What happened?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.840
700..?

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.560
Demoted even before
I started the job.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.880
Brother, where is 39-40?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.240
Hey, ..this way.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.120
Down here. Come down.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.040
Hello. Coming.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.200
Come.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.560
Here you go. Now fix it.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.200
- 70,000 rupees for fixing this.
- 70,000?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.520
Fine. Come down and collect the cash.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.800
And listen..

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.680
Don't feel embarassed if you
need anything else, Gunjan.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.600
Okay. Okay..

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.040
Yes..
Is the inverter fixed?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.840
He wants 70,000 rupees
for fixing the inverter.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.400
I just went to the
washroom for two minutes..

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.000
..and inflation broke all the barriers.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.000
Sir.. not that.
This..

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.720
So you are not the service person?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.640
- I came for the interview.
- Interview?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.840
- Yes sir.
- But we don't have any job for you.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.480
Sir, I have a first class degree
even when I am a middle-class person

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.520
I've done my Bachelors
as well as Masters in Arts,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.000
Even Masters in Philosophy.
Take a look.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.520
Please..
I even know Croatia work.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.080
I can make a dancing
peacock on a sweater.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.720
Anything except for getting pregnant.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.000
Please give me one chance.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.680
- To get pregnant?
- To work.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.200
Listen brother..we don't
want any peacocks to dance here.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.320
- Please leave. Here you go..
- Please, sir..

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.280
- He's so importunate.
- I'll do it, sir.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.760
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do it, sir.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.040
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do anything..

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.960
- We don't have a job for you.
- I will do anything sir.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.680
I will do it, sir.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.960
Please sir..
I will do it, sir.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.120
Come on.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.120
It's bathroom. What kind of job, sir?

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.360
Come, let me show you.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.240
See..See..take a good look.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.400
I don't want a girl, I want a job.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.480
I am not showing you the girl.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.560
- Then?
- Come here.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.240
Come.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.520
Listen..Listen very carefully.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.120
Hi, baby..

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.440
How are you?
You miss me after a long time.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.040
Sweet talks..friendship..

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.840
..love calls.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.680
This is a friendship call centre.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.800
Of course, I love you a lot.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.720
Will you call me back tomorrow?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.200
Of course, sweetheart.
We will meet someday.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.760
Kissing and all is fine,
But don't misbehave with me.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.000
Understand..

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.040
What are you saying sir!

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.320
You mean the electric
store is just a front face..

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.320
..but the real shocker
is the inner side.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.200
- Understood right?
- Yes..

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.680
Now get out. Get out.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.080
- Sir..
- What now?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.240
Pooja has not turned up again.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.120
And her phone's been
ringing continuously.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200
Do you expect me to answer?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.680
Transfer the call to someone else.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.360
But he's her regular customer.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.640
He doesn't talk to me, there's no
chance that he will talk to anyone else.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.240
Spare me please.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.560
We will meet later.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.720
I must find a permanent solution
for Pooja.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.400
- Lately she has been skipping work a lot.
- Hello.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.560
I am Pooja

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.360
What happened?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.800
Did't you like my voice?

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.080
You did, right?

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.160
Then.. let's continue talking.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.240
you will like the conversations
even better, lover boy.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.440
Bye, love you.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.440
Tired?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.520
Yes.. He was!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.320
Bravo, my boy.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.000
You raised the customer's
bill to 3000 rupees.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.320
You are a very talented man.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.240
But have no pride about it.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.480
You sound so convincing as a female.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.840
- How do you do it?
- It comes naturally.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.920
What is this?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.520
Advance.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.120
You got the job, Pooja baby.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.200
I get the job..
Me? Pooja baby?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.320
Sir..Thank you, sir.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.640
Sir..this will payfor all of my debts.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.480
Read it first.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.760
All I am doing for last 15-17
years is reading but to no avail.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.520
Now I am just going to
write here, sir.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.840
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.360
- Go easy on the betel leaf.
- Yes.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.360
- Join the job from tomorrow.
- Of course, sir.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.600
What a nice piece of advice for you?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.200
Shut your mouth.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.840
What do you want..

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.600
You?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.640
Come inside.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.480
Hurry up.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.720
Why didn't you come
to the Ramleela yesterday?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.080
Today is a dry day.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.760
I sold so many bottles yesterday..

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.040
..that I had to give
my personal bottles in the end.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.320
Before going to bed
I had to take milk instead.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.480
♪♪Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.♪♪

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.960
Delivery's closed. You'll
have to collect it yourself today.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.360
Already here?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.760
That's pretty fast.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.960
What do you..

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.760
- What's wrong, uncle?
- Come on, out with it.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.640
No alcohol on a dry day, sir.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.760
I've warned you not to
open your shop on dry days.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.000
- But..
- But you never understand.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.000
- Now pay the fine.
- The shop's closed.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.800
I am with my girlfriend.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.880
Girlfriend?
What's your girlfriend doing here?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.360
Unfortunately,
uncle, we can't go to her place..

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.560
..and I don't have
a mattress at my place.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.680
Now you tell me what should I do.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.240
- Try to understand.
- Who is it, darling?

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.120
Police, baby..

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.480
First, they used to raid the hotels,
now they are raiding wine shops too.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.560
And I can't even reach
the hook of my blouse.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes, I'll help you.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.040
See sir..

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.560
I can't see a thing.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.000
Why don't you buy a mattress at home.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.400
I will, at Diwali.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.080
Don't forget.
Let's go.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.040
Don't you dare open the shop.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.080
Bro..your voice saved us again.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.480
Stop talking..

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.760
Open a beer.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.040
You seem to be in a very good mood.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.480
I got a job in Faridabad.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.400
You shouldn't be lying on a dry day.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.520
Drunkards will curse you.
Don't do it.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.920
Look..25,000 advance.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.560
Awsome !!

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.200
We're going to drink until we drop.
The party's on me.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.000
Uncle, you're back?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.000
I go out for one day..

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.080
..and you turn my
place into hell.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.680
We were just enjoying, uncle.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.920
This isn't enjoyment... it's debauchery.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.760
Uncle..debauchery would be if you had
found us in the arms of some Russian gals.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.560
We were enjoying because
my friend here, got a job.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.320
If you are still high from last night,
then spray some acid on your face.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.320
He is right, Dad. I got a job.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.160
Heard that..
- Look..

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.920
25,000 advance.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.880
Bless me.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.080
Radhe-Radhe.
God Bless you, son.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.760
- 25,000 advance.
- Yes.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.240
Which company gives so much advance?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.080
That is the issue,
when people earning 2500..

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.240
..get 25000 in their hands,
they tend to loose their mind.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.760
Shut up.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.080
Go away..

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.040
Which company?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.240
Call Cent..

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.600
Colgate. Colgate Colgate company.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.240
Radhe-Radhe. It's a very good news..

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.320
..now I can repay my debts
and also get free toothpaste.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.680
- There are only two problems
in your life, dad. - What?

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.520
Loan and Alone!

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.520
And we need to decrease your interest
in one and increase in the other.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.280
Let's find you a beautiful
bride and get you married.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.520
Don't be crazy.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.840
You are old enough to get married now.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.960
You are not that old yet.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.160
If we don't count the public
holidays then you'll still be 26.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.400
Bro, you should love
your dad and not mislead him.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.560
Am I right, uncle.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.680
Be quiet.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.440
- Uncle, love you too.
- Mr. Jagjeet.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.040
- Yes.
- There is someone at the shop.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.480
Go take a look.
Must be from the Thakur family.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.360
What will it take to
get a cup of tea around here?

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.280
Shut up, you stupid.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.920
You made me forget the count..

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.120
500..1000..

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.280
Here is all your stuff.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.400
2250 rupees.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.160
I forgot my wallet at home.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.480
We take PayTm as well.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.000
What is PayTm?

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.640
So naive.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.280
Do you know that there's a new 2000
currency note in the market?

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.880
I am not that naive.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.120
Hello.
I am on my way back.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200
Did you pack camphor (Kapoor)?

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.320
Here.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.880
20 rupees.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.120
So cheap.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.480
Not every Kapoor is Ranbir Kapoor.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.920
Total 2270 rupees.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.200
Take it.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.840
It's too much for one man to carry.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.560
Help me deliver this stuff
and collect your money as well.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.880
Grandpa...

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.560
- Slowdown!
- Mourning again

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.040
I am just the delivery guy.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.480
- I see..
- Hello.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.640
Hello.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.280
Come.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.440
[sankrit chants]

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.720
Hello.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.200
Deepak.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.040
Pay his bill.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.560
Hari. This isn't spicy enough.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.000
Bring some more chilly.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.360
Who is the old lady?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.440
She is the Thakur's wife, do you know?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.480
No..

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.520
Does she know her
husband has passed away?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.840
Yes, she does.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.720
But grandpa had turned 95.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.880
Which is why she
isn't wailing or crying?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.000
No! I will go..

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.680
I don't believe in such nonsense.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.400
Grandma..what is she talking about?

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.640
I am going to the crematorium,
and that's it.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.520
I don't want to listen.
I am coming downstairs.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.920
Mahi.. stop!

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.560
What's the name?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.800
Mahinder.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.400
Doesn't that sound too
manly to be a girl's name?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.160
No. My name is Mahinder.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.800
Her name is Mahi.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.920
Mahi.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.760
Married?

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.400
No. Celibate..

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.360
A female who is a celibate.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.080
Not the girl, I am a celibate.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.600
She is still in college.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.640
You don't know what's PayTm
but you keep a tab on every women.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.520
That's because she is my granny
and that's my younger sister Mahi.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.440
Mo..Money..

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.760
Yes..where did Deepak get stuck?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.440
- Give me a minute, let me check.
- Okay.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.080
This isn't right.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.560
Grandpa has always been with me.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.680
From school to college,
he accompanied me everywhere.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.200
Why can't I accompany
him on his final journey?

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.120
This isn't right, dear.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.200
Women have always followed men.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.760
It's for their own good.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.280
That's absurd, Poonam aunty.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.160
Don't forget this is Gokul.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.120
The place where Radha's
name is taken before Krishna's.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.520
And Sita's before Ram's.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.960
Women have always been ahead of men,
history is a proof.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.000
- Who are you?
- Don't bother about me.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.760
Please continue.
You are speaking really well.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.600
In fact..take grandma with you as well.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.920
Even she is a woman.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.240
God forbid if anything happens to her..

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.480
...which will...

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.120
Will you bury her in your backyard?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.480
And never take her to the crematorium.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.160
- Right, grandma.
- Who the heck are you?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.120
Wanting me to die so early.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.520
Karamveer,
I live infront of the Gokul Temple.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.360
House no. 865/1

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.600
Aunty..you must also
go to the crematorium.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.760
Not every woman looks
good on their deathbed.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.680
Where is my money?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.000
Here you are.
Is it all here?

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.280
Radhe-Radhe.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.160
Your mother would
have been so happy today.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.040
That her son is climbing
the ladder of success.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.400
Look.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.680
But this is Hema Malini.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.680
That's my dream girl.
This is your mother.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.120
Take her blessings.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.920
She would have been extremely happy.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.200
You are a wonderful boy.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.000
Because boys these days
claim one thing and do another.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.480
- Rascals.
- Dad..I am getting late.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.000
Listen, I have a question.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.120
Why the night shift?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.760
When we make toothpaste all night..

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.400
..then only can people brush
their teeth in the morning.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.080
I never thought of that.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.120
Here is 101 rupees as good luck.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.520
Tonight is your first night,
Pooja baby.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.360
All the best, dear.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.760
She will transfer the calls to you.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.400
Radhe-Radhe.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.240
Hello.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.400
The call's connected.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.760
I am Pooja.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.800
- Who is this?
- Dev speaking.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.240
Pooja baby..come over.
there's three of us.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.600
Do you want the 4th one to accompany
you for your father's final rights?

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.960
Hang up!

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.080
What are you doing?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.960
Why are you yelling at the customers?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.920
Customers are God.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.680
Which God calls up a girl at 2 am?

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.000
We've to raise their bill,
and not our blood pressure.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.160
Understand.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.760
Understood?

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.880
Hello.
Is this Pooja?

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.960
Yes, this is your Pooja.
Who is this?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.600
Gurbachan Singh speaking.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.640
Gurpu.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.040
Are you fine?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.320
What?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.320
I said are you fine?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.920
Yes, I am fine.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.160
- Is this Pooja?
- You are right.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.240
And you win a dozen smooches
from me for the right guess.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.320
My girlfriend dumped me.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.560
I am with you. Don't worry.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.440
I have enough money.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.000
But I can't find
a bride to marry.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.080
How old are you?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.200
Sweet-70.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.280
Stop looking for a bride..

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.200
..and start looking for
a bus for your final destination.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.440
Who is speaking?

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.080
This is your Pooja speaking.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.840
Wow..you have a very sweet voice.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.120
Thank you.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.880
You know, whenever I talk to you,
I want to do things to you.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.640
What things?

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.680
You know..

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.280
What you're mistaking for Taj Mahal
is actually Qutub Minar.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.200
- Now hang up.
- Oh really?

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.640
Hi, I am Pooja.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.600
Hello. Pooja speaking.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.680
I am Pooja speaking.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.200
Hi, Pooja speaking.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.640
Hello. I am Pooja.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.680
You are not Pooja.
Give the phone to Pooja.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160
Are you drunk?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.600
How do you know?

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.080
I can smell it all the way.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.640
I see..you are a smart one.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.520
Anyway..

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.160
From today you will be my regular.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.360
Wait..hold on.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.040
Stop calling me over
and over again, mom.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.080
I am busy..

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.560
If you call again,
then I'll turn my phone off.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.280
Hello.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.120
Is there someone
more important than me?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.760
No one. It's just my mom.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.520
She keeps disturbing me all the time.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.200
Maybe it's important.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.040
It's nothing important.
All mothers are like this.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.600
I am sure your mother's like this too.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.920
See, I have lost my mother

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.160
So talk politely to your
mother just like you talk to me.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.720
But my mother doesn't
sound sweet like you.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.960
What to do?

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.120
You are crazy.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.520
That I am.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
Can I hang up now?

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.720
Okay.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.640
But I will wait for your call.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.600
I see..naughty girl.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.120
You must have enjoyed today, right?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.600
How was your first night?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.240
It wasn't my wedding night.
I was working.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.280
The kind of job you are doing
I don't think there is much difference.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.200
Didn't you get any lewd calls?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.320
A couple of rascals did call.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.600
But the call after
that..really shocked me.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.560
People are very lonely.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.480
They don't have a friend.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.960
And some are so lonely..

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.920
..that their loneliness
is all they have to cling on to.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.640
It's quiet true.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.080
These cops just
don't leave anyone alone.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.720
Another Police barricade.
Do you have some money?

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.320
Let me check.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.760
Out for a midnight drive?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.400
Where are you coming
from Fred and Barney?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120
Office.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.480
Drunk.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.400
No..

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.280
We are drunk.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.120
We need a ride.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.680
But three men are
not allowed on a bike.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.920
I see..

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.200
Gurpreet..are you comfortable?

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.040
Not every Sardar is
a Gurpreet or a Harpreet.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.640
My name's Smiley.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.960
But in case you are not comfortable..

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.000
..I'll sit on the handlebar instead.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.880
No..why would you sit on the handlebar?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.720
Just a little longer.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.880
We'll get off at the next block.
Right.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.080
How about a few lines..

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.440
Bravo. Bravo.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.760
Death is inevitable.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.360
And love is filled
with suffering and pain.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:36.080
Life is filled with hardships
and this is where we get off.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.680
Stop the bike.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I'll get down here.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.680
But your destination
hasn't arrived yet.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.080
I am so high that I just remembered..

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.840
..my home's on the route to Noida.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.240
No wonder..
Stop here! Stop!

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.160
Shift back.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.480
- Jawahar.
- Yes.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.360
Don't show up on time tomorrow.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.440
Only if I get home safe and sound.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.240
Stop. Stop.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.400
You're a natural poet.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.520
Your poems are filled with pain.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.640
Once you are married son..

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.520
The pain and suffering
come out through your words.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.200
And on that note..here's another.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.960
No, we're in a hurry

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.400
Fine Then just say bravo.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.160
Because you know I am good at it.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.400
Bravo. Bravo.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.840
See you then.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.160
'I am searching you everywhere.'

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.360
Not at this hour.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.080
Not that. Extra income

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.440
Silly girl, I am a poet
and poets only write poems..

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.080
..and not take bribe.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.280
- Here's a fresh one.
- Shut up.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.960
Mr. Poet..

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.960
Your poetry isn't going
to improve our condition.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.720
The constable next door
just bought a used car.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.000
And look at you who has to take
a lift every day to get home.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.800
And you are drunk again.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.640
Have you ever seen me drinking?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.840
Seriously?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.080
Are the children asleep?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.400
Children? We have only one kid.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.840
Then I must be drunk.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.960
Make it hot.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.080
What?

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.040
Dinner, what else.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.800
Why do you get romantic all the time?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.960
Of course, because that's
all I am good for anyway.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.200
You come home drunk,
and I serve you your dinner.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.800
What else do you want?

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.360
You want to drink instead.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.600
Shut up.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.240
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.120
Here take it.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.640
Tell him.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.480
White hair in the food.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.880
When the cook's got white hair,
then what else do you expect?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.600
I wonder when we'll find
some black hair in the food.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.560
That reminds me..I
have searched for a bride

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.280
Really?

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.800
But no..

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.000
As I said before,
I don't want to get married.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.880
Uncle, he meant for himself.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.080
I see.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.320
But son. who is she? Where is she from?

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.520
What about her family?

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.440
There are only 3 members in the family.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.960
The oldest one is the Grandmother, who
is older than the French Revolution.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.120
- Seriously.
- The other one is Mahinder.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.080
A staunch celibate. Bachelor.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.200
And the only females in his
life is Gita, Sunita, Babita, Lalita..

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.360
So many.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.440
Cows and Buffaloes.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.760
And the third one is your
daughter-in-law Mahi.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.480
Beautiful, Talented.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.680
5'4 inches.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.280
She is completing her Home
Science from the University.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.920
And she is such a good cook..
She will cook for you.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.000
Finally, we'll get
some good food around here.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.720
Is this bad?
Keep it down.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.720
No, it's nice. I am eating.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.720
Tell me something more.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.880
It's the Thakur family
that live in the manor.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.360
But they are nobles.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.480
We aren't exactly paupers either.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.280
Get me more stuffed bread, uncle.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.440
We're out of flour, son.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.480
Baby..your birthday's
on the 23rd, right.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.760
Yes.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.000
I'll gift you a diamond ring.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.720
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.720
- I'll miss you.
- Bye. See you.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.360
Thank you.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.160
Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.720
Hello, ma'am.
- What hello?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.720
What is this?

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.600
- When will you finish this work?
- That..

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.280
Baby.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.560
- You?
- Can I have some cash?

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.720
- Yeah, sure.
- Cash.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.360
You were just talking about
gifting her a diamond ring.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.520
Are you going to buy
that ring with her money?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600
Poor guy.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.960
Why?

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.520
You are new around here.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.480
She's had three breakups.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.720
And she doesn't trust men anymore.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.600
Men are just leeches.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.480
- No, ma'am..
- Am I right?

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.520
You guys can only break hearts right.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.520
What breaking hearts?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.120
Then why did she hire us?

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.120
So she can humiliate us every day.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.120
I don't carry cash, only cards.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.400
I see..

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.520
Cards.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.120
Like these four visiting
cards and loose change.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.680
She has reached the
pinnacle of success..

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.000
She even learnt English..

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.920
But still has no class.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.200
Show me your phone.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.400
I said show me your phone.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.840
Ma'am, it's personal.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.960
What are you doing, sister?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.240
What sister?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.720
Do I look like your sister?

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.520
- No, you are not..
- Then?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.920
And who are they?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.680
They must be your sisters as well,
aren't they?

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.200
Or were you planning to buy
diamond rings for them as well?

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.280
Baby, I can explain.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.280
What..are you going to explain, Jatin.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.520
Who are they?

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.680
Baby, I love you.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.080
Just shut up. I don't want
to see your face. Get out from here.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.080
- I love you.
- I said get out.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.120
You heard her. Get out!

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.600
Don't try to threaten me.
Get lost.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.480
And what are you all watching?

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.960
What is so funny?

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.800
Rajpal.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.920
- Rajpal.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.480
Rajpal..what is this?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.040
Register, sir.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.800
I know that, uncle.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.920
But read this out for me.
Please..

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.000
Sunil Bhardwaj, son of Om Bharadwaj,
Resident of Faridabad's..

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.280
..motorcycle went missing from..

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.800
..Chetterbata Chowk
on the 25th of the month..

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.600
..O my crazy heart, what have you done
I feel like I'm neither alive nor dead.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.160
What is wrong with me?

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.840
I think someone wrote
an FIR in the poem.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.400
Not someone.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.520
You again wrote a poem
in the FIR register!

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.480
Me?

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.760
How many times have I told you..

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.600
Keep your poet in your..

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.880
Outside this Police Station.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.120
Otherwise,
I'll lock you up without an FIR.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.320
I just thought of two more lines..

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.400
Bravo.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.080
Fix this first.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.960
How dare you tease a police officer?

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.400
I'll throw you out where
you'll starve to death.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.400
I am not teasing you, uncle.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.720
Since morning I've been observing
that no one's listening to your poems.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:25.920
Will you?

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.480
I won't either. But I can help you.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.640
Give me your phone.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.400
Why do you want my phone?

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.640
Give it to me once.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.440
What is this?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.680
This is a special number.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.360
She will listen to everything you say,
and even repond to it.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.880
I see..

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.520
- Would you like some tea?
- Liquor would be better.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.360
Don't try to take
advantage of the situation.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.960
No tea for you.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.480
Uncle..listen..

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.320
Let's try this number..

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.040
Hello.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.400
Hello, who is this?

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.640
This is Pooja.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.120
Pooja.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.440
What a sweet name.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.240
And even a sweeter voice.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.160
Enough about me,
tell me something about yourself.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.400
And a Haryanvi too.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.640
- Are you from Rohtak too?
- No, Panipat.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.600
Panipat. Great!

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.920
What do you do?

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560
Well..I

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.080
I am a poetic.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.400
You mean you're a poet.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.920
- Are they different?
- Yes.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.680
Then whatever you said.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.320
Why don't you recite
a few lines for me.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.840
Will you listen to it?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.920
- Really?
- Of course..

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.520
I just came up with
this a few hours ago.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.680
My heart says I should meet her.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.960
My heart says I should meet her.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.480
but my mind says that you are on duty.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.920
Bravo... Bravo...

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.760
Really?

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.520
Too good.
Superb.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920
Thank you.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
If you don't mind,
can I say something too?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.600
Are you a poet too?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.000
Occasionally.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.640
Encore. Encore.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.520
You mean go for it.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.280
- Are they different too?
- Obviously.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.000
Then whatever you said.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.200
- Hear this.
- Yes.. yes..

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.400
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.840
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.920
My mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.680
My, my, my..

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.480
Stop wailing.
We haven't found your bike yet.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.760
Sir, its the guy who lost his bike.
He's been bothering me.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.280
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.720
There's no sign of electricity,
but the bill is always on time.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.480
Hurry up.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.600
- Here you go.
- The website is pretty slow.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.200
And the office is close to my college.
I'll pay the bill here.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.760
Yes.
Yes, okay. Bye.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.240
- Pay your bill.
- What are you doing?

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.120
Today is the last date?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.760
But I think it's my first date.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.480
I see..

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.560
House no. 865/1.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.600
Close to Gokul Temple.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.920
I've been observing for some time now..

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.800
..that you and your friend
have been following me everywhere.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.880
Be it my home or restaurant.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.920
Hello.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.000
Don't be under any delusion.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.320
Only I am following you.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.920
When a boy shifts his entire focus
on a girl, do you know what it means?

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.160
Yes..

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.560
That he is extremely free

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.480
Maybe he's a busy guy..

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.480
..and freed up his schedule
for someone special.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.840
Cardamom tea, strong coffee..

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.760
- One tea for me.
- It's over already.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.640
Strong coffee, cardamom tea..

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.960
Would you prefer tea or coffee?

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280
None

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.480
Waste of money.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.040
- Uncle, you wanted tea.
- Don't want it now.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.280
- Come on.
- I said I don't want it.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.800
- You can pay me half the price.
- I don't want it.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.840
Honestly, first time in my
life I am enjoying a queue this long.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.080
Can I be honest too?

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.800
You talk too much.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.400
But you speak well.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.400
Every day's a Rose Day.
Every day's a Rose Day.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.120
- Every day's a Rose Day.
- Give me a Rose.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.480
Come on.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.160
What? Do you want one?

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.680
Come, I'll get you one.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.880
Come on.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.160
Give me your..bill.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.160
Bill.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.360
Actually, you got the hint right.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.520
I want our electricity
bill to be on the same address.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.200
865/1

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.440

Hello. Pooja speaking.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.080
Give the phone to Pooja
and tell her its Roma.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.720
I promise you will
like talking to this Pooja better.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.080
Don't play smart with me, okay.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.520
This is not my first call.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.720
What are you looking at? Get lost?

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.680
You don't know who I am.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.760
Edgy on the outside,
still on the inside.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.160
- That's who you are.
- Wow.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.280
You nailed that.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.240
Although it was a fluke,
you have hit the right spot.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.640
I guess your heart and trust
have been shattered more than once.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.040
Yeah.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.560
Long story.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.640
Three boys broke my heart.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.200
Why do you do it with
three boys at a time?

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.160
Hey..not like that.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.800
At different times.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.440
Trust me,
I am speaking out of experience.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.960
All men are dogs.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.520
In fact..If I could have my wish

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.960
..I would strip them naked
and crush them under a bulldozer.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.040
Cool crush them under a bulldozer..

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.680
..but what is the
need to strip them naked?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.440
All men are..

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.360
Not every guy is same.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.680
Hey, don't address me as sister.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.560
I don't look like a sister.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.400
Trust has no gender.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.080
Women can be just as deceptive.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.240
Not Really.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:25.360
Girls are..sensitive,
sensible, understanding.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.080
Like you and me.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.120
Finally, I feel better
after talking to you.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.280
Me too.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.520
In fact, you sound a lot
better than the previous Pooja.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.600
Today onwards you are Pooja for me.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.720
It's ringing. It's ringing.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.160
Hello.
- Hello.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.080
How are you doing, Pooja?

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.960
I am doing great.
Did you write anything new?

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.560
Of course, I did..just yesterday.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:05.200
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.280
To destroy itself..in love.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.440
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.400
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.600
Oh, God.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.040
You've fallen too low.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.280
You write so well, why don't
you work on your pronunciation.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.960
There are also other things
in world other than love.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.280
Why don't you try writing about them?

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.480
Yes, of course.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.800
How can I say no to my Pooja?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.000
Look..you're my Pooja.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.520
Only my Pooja.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.360
My Pooja. My foot...My Pooja. My Pooja.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.880
Just doesn't leave me alone...

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.480
No need to come to the
call centre from tomorrow.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.080
My thoughts exactly, sir.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.680
And anyway,
the loans have been almost repaid.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.400
Here are the car keys.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.880
It's right outside. Park it.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.760
And do it properly.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.000
Pooja Darling,
congratulations on the new office.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.520
What is this, sir?

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.600
I was not asking you
to quit the call centre.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.520
Then.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.720
Starting from today
this car is your new office.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.720
Now Pooja is available
24/7 for her fans.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.160
How?

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.280
Open that box.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.160
Smartwatch.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.120
And I can keep the car too.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.640
Thank you, sir.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.560
By the way, I didn't deserve this car..

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.000
Get going or should I take the keys.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.040
Going.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.160
Who parked this car
in front of my house?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.560
Is this yours?

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.040
No, it's not mine.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.440
It cannot be yours.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.200
Whose car is this?

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.760
Papa, this is our car.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.040
- Our car?
- Yes.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.200
Did you take a loan as well?

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.800
The company gifted me.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.200
Radhe-Radhe.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.240
Radhe-Radhe.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.400
Pooja..

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.200
Don't scare me like that.
Why can't you say it directly?

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.840
But it's necessary.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.080
Work is worship.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.640
Come here.
Sit.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.200
- Come on.
- I see...

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.800
Sideways..

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.160
Tuck your shirt in.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.960
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.240
To destroy itself..in love.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.000
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.520
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.560
Nice. Who wrote it?

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.720
I...... did not.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.680
A friend of mine, who is a poet.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.600
- Nice, isn't it?
- It is.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.960
Take it.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.160
leave it.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.720
Enjoying the drive.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.680
Pick it up. It can be important.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.960
Okay..

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.760
- Hello Pooja.
- Wrong number.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.240
Hello Pooja, this is Rahul.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.160
There is no Pooja here.
I told you its a wrong number.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.560
But I regularly speak
with Pooja on this number.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.920
I said hang up.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.080
People call all the
time asking for some Pooja.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.800
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.920
Hello.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.640
- New car?
- Yes...

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.560
Hello.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.840
Is this Pooja speaking?

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.080
If you called on Pooja's number, then
you can't expect Diana Penty to pick up.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.200
Panty?

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.840
You didn't notice I said Diana,
you dog.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.800
Don't call me a dog.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.080
- Hello...
- Deepak, move.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.920
There's enough space.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.400
Your sound like you
are a very handsome guy.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.040
Do you want to meet me?

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.960
It's my mother from Benares.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.800
Your mother from Benaras, huh..

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.400
Do you have a mother in every city?

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.400
Let me hear her voice.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.520
What happened, Kishore?
Who is disturbing us?

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.400
Your mother has such a sweet voice.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.200
Whose mother is this?

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.160
Mother?

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240
Pooja.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.040
People call me Pooja with love.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.560
What can I call you?

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.880
Well, call me anything you like..

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.320
Well, call me anything you like..

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.520
Don't tell her your real name.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.360
Rafi. His name is Rafi.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.160
Wow..what a match. Kishore and Rafi.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.080
Then sing something for me, Rafi.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.640
Sorry, but I don't sing.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.400
How is it possible? How can
you not sing if your name is Rafi?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.640
Impossible.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.360
Brother has a velvety voice.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.400

Not good.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.600
I haven't cut the cake yet.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.920
I kept insisting.. let's meet,
let's met.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.680
Fine, don't come.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.360
Are you taking me for a ride?

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.440
Don't be stubborn, Toto.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.000
I've told you before.
we can't meet.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.120
Will you like it if
I get fired from the job.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.440
Yes, I will.
Then you can stay with me.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.000
I will marry you.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.400
You are too young.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.560
Marry me and I will grow up.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.640
So..when are we meeting?

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.960
Like I said we can't meet.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.280
You will have to meet me, Pooja.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.640
Or else you will regret it.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.480
You can do whatever you want.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.040
Hello..

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.840
Hung up on me.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.760
Now watch what I do.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.240
Jawahar..are you there yet?

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.200
Long time ago

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.080
I will be leaving soon.
Just waiting for a ride.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.600
Wait for me.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.200
Coming.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.920
It's you.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.040
He is our guy.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.000
You got so tired
of giving us a lift..

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.080
..that you bought a car instead.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.320
Let's go.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.560
Feels nice whenever I see you.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.040
You remind me of someone.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.400
Are you married?

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.000
No, sir. Just got engaged.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.760
What about you?

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.880
Look at the forehead.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:10.960
Married women have a tint of
vermillion and men have lines of worry.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.640
That's frown.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.800
Are they different?

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.040
Yes.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.120
So..whatever you say.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.880
Sir, you should only
marry the one you love.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.360
That's so true.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.360
On that note,
you must hear this poem.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.440
My heart says I should meet her.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.640
What does it say?

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.800
My heart says I should meet her.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.520
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.880
How was it?

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.360
Look..trouble calling.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680
Where are you?

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.200
I'll be late.
Stop calling me repetitively.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.080
If you can't stand me,
then why don't you divorce me.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.240
Fine, I will divorce you soon.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.600
I have also found someone else.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.760
The one who has improved my
poetry will reform my life as well.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.840
I know one thing..

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.120
One should marry the one you love.
Right?

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.160
Even I will marry my Pooja.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.920
Will you hang up or should I?

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.440
Go to hell!

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.080
See..

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.680
Turn here.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.760
I am heading to the hospital.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.040
Hospital?

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.440
Boys these days don't
know anything about love.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.320
The girl refused to meet
and the guy slit his wrist.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.560
Imagine..

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.680
So..here we are.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.640
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.240
What did you
say the guy's name was?

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.960
- Toto.
- Toto..

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.040
Yes.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.360
Toto!

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.680
Wedding's around the corner..

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.080
And one guy slit his wrist.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.880
another one is dumping his wife..

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.920
..and the other one
is a female herself.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.080
Everyone's after me.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.000
I don't know whether I should
dress like a groom or a bride.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.880
You know what..you'll
look amazing in a wedding gown too.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.800
Rascal..I am in no mood for jokes.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.840
I am quitting my job.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.040
So who is stopping you?

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.440
But why tell Mahi about it?

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.680
Mahi is a nice girl.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.880
The foundation of any
relationship is trust.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.360
I can break her heart
but not her trust.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.400
Great!

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.440
Great.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.840
Till date,
my hero was Kookie Dhillon.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.520
Who is that idiot?

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.880
My father.

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.320
And now you are too..

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.560
What? Your father?

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.880
My hero bro.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.960
Go and tell whomever you like.
Smiley is with you always.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.040
Quit your job.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.960
And inform your boss.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.040

Maybe upstairs.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.400
Brother-in-law. I have a question.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.320
Go on.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.320
You know that Mahi and Granny
are the only females in my life.

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.000
I already know that.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.800
Fine, I am going to ask.

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:52.640
If I want to tell a female
friend..about my feelings.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.880
Then how do I do it?

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.560
Which buffalo are you in love with now?

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.080
Don't get me wrong.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.760
Tell me.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.000
Ask her..

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.920
..can I get rid of my single
bed and get a double bed instead?

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.800
And if she says yes, then it's a yes.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.800
What if she says no.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.320
Then pull her on the single bed.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.720
Then pull her on the single bed.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.240
These customers
don't stop calling..

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.880
Hello. Who is this?

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.080
It's me.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.760
Rafi.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.120
I don't want to hear
any song at this time.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.280
I don't want to sing,
I want to tell you my feelings.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.760
Feelings? Go ahead.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.720
We've been talking for so long.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.680
I am in love with me.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.480
I was wondering..

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.840
..can I get rid of my single
bed and buy a double bed instead?

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.600
- Huh?
- Yes?

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.040
Karam.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.760
What's wrong with him?

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.040
Why is he dancing?
Did he win a lottery?

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.440
He did..

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.600
He really did.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.760
Brother, what's wrong?

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.240
You have a very talented son.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.200
He can mimic so many voices.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.720
And especially he is very
convincing as a female.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.720
Are females not
convincing enough as themselves?

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.920
A guy mimicking a female's
voice is not a good thing.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.680
But..I am really
happy that he joined your company.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.520
Greetings, Sita Maiya.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.240
Come. Come.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.240
Karam.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.000
When you didn't answer my calls..

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.640
..I thought I'll personally
pay my respects to Sita Maiya.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.720
Mr. Jagjit, your son is
a very dedicated worker.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.200
Your program is telecasted
live all over Gokul.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.400
I saw it too.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.000
But I didn't know.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:05.160
Mr. Jagjeet..I was thinking why don't
I show his work live as well.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.000
He will become very popular.

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.560
That's a great idea.
Let's not delay.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840
Right, son.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.720
Shall we?

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.840
- Goodbye.
- Radhe Radhe.

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.680
O Hello. Please stop it for a minute.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.200
Can we discuss business?

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.480
Hey Karam, Radhe-Radhe.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.200
Wow..people respect you a lot.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.600
If you don't show up for work..

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:38.640
..then I'll put up big posters
of you all over the city.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.200
When I am good, I am good.

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.880
But when I am bad..

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.320
..I am even better.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.040
Radhe-Shyam.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.520
Come on, guys.
You guys play really well.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.440
He's already played me.
So stop playing.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.600
What did he say?

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.320
You told me to quit my job.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.440
Pass me the tea..

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.560
Take it.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.400
Its' a bad day.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.080
It's an auspicious day.
Come on, guys.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.520
Start playing.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.840
Take it.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.920
Eat.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.560
Look..

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.560
Forget it. It's your wedding bro..

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.040
And look how happy your father is

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.560
Forget it and enjoy your life.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400
Uncle, come here.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.280
Son, I got two wedding
dresses stitched.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.480
Now you choose which one should I wear?

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.720
- Why don't you wear both of them.
- Great.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.040
One for your wedding,
and the other..

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.040
Uncle,
I am in no mood to get married.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.640
I am not talking about you..

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.600
I was talking about my wedding.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.640
- Your wedding?
- Yes, son.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.640
I haven't told you yet..

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.240
I've..

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.880
.. heard a mother for you.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.960
Heard?

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.600
The term is ♪♪to see♪♪ uncle.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.240
But I have only heard her.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.240
And you must have heard the
name she addresses your father with.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.640
Rahul.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.800

'I just want to meet you.'

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.080
Pooja.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.960
I love you Pooja.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.120
I can't live without you.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.360
Will you..

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.400
..marry me?

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
What..

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.120
What?

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.480
This is how I will
propose your future mother, Pooja.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.920
And I'll adorn this
ring on her finger.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.080
Don't you dare adorn
or take anything off her.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:13.920
What's wrong now?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.400
Because you don't have my approval.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.400
But son, you always insisted
that I should get married.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.720
And now I am saying
that you cannot marry her.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.000
I don't approve of this relationship.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.920
But son, Pooja is a very nice girl.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.720
You make it sound like you raised her.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.120
Maybe she looks at you
like a father figure.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.040
This is unfair..completely..

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.040
I don't care if you treat
me as your father or not..

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.960
..but don't call me her father.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.800
And you always said that
I don't look a day older than 26.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.000
Let jokes be jokes.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.200
She spoke to you nicely on the phone..

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.840
..and you think she is your property.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.960
No means No!

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.160
My jacket.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.560
That's my jacket you're wearing.
Take it off!

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.480
Enter.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.400
Mother. Mother.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.000
Son, where had you been all day?

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.320
Mother. Look what I won.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.600
Whatever it is son,
share it equally with your brothers.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.720
- What the..
- Brother.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.520
Has mother lost her eyesight?

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.800
Mother, you are not blind.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880
How can you give
instructions without looking?

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.160
You are absolutely right.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.920
Forget him.
You belong to us now.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.240
Mother's order is inevitable.
Right?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.080
From today Draupadi is our wife.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.320
Absolutely right.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.640
Mother's order must be carried out.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.640
Carried out.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.440
- Mother's order must be carried out.
- No..

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.520
Don't you dare lay a finger on me?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.880
We don't wish to lay our
hands but set our hearts on you

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.400
- Draupadi shall be mine.
- Get lost.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.480
She will be mine.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.840
She will be mine.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.840
She will be mine.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.640
I wish you heard what
Draupadi had to say about it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.400
Mother warned you against gambling too.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.960
- Then why the hell..
- What?

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.240
.. Why didn't you
listen to your mother then?

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.000
Why did you put Draupadi at
stake after losing everything?

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.920
- Draupadi, please.
- Take your hands off.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.240
Karam, what are you doing?

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320
I don't have a single
dialogue and he's hitting me.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.520
You're confusing the scenes.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.880
This scene comes much later.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
But it's on the list, isn't it?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.000
How long will this unfair
treatment of women continue?

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.640
We are not some object.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.040
If there was MeeToo during Mahabharat..

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.320
..you guys would
be sitting behind the bars.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.840
- Dear Draupadi..
- Get lost.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.640
Hey Karam, wait.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.600
Count me out.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.600
- Karam.. Wait..
- I am fed up.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.280
Karam..listen..

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.840
This is my first
time with you on stage..

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.840
..and you are leaving
the rehearsals midway.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.320
I am not going to
be a part of this show.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.520
That's it. Stop here.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.080
What are you guys doing out here?

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.600
Are rehearsals over?

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.240
What on earth are you doing here?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.080
I made a new soup and
thought you should taste it.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.480
I am in no mood to eat.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.160
It's not all that bad.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.000
And what's wrong with your mood?

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.920
It's Smiley's fault.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.280
My fault?

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.920
Yes..how can you forget?

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.720
Please remind me.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.920
There are a couple
of girls chasing him.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.160
After him?

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.760
Yes..

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.520
Right?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.600
Yes, sister-in-law.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.040
Being handsome is a crime these days.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.240
And if I say a few polite words,
they think I am available.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.840
- Where do I take my handsomeness..
- Enough.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.840
There is a girl who he truly loves.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.280
But doesn't know how to
get rid of these inbetweeners.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.680
That's pretty simple.
Stop talking to them.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.200
You don't think I tried..
I mean don't you think he tried that.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400
But now they are
insisting on a meeting.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.760
Yes, sister-in-law. They are threatening
me to slit their wrist or whatever.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.200
- Where do I take my..
- Enough!

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.560
What will the poor guy do?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.440
I don't know.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.640
Sorry.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.520
Taste this for me.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.440
I am having tea.
I don't want any damn soup!

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.360
I put in so much effort
to make this soup for you.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.720
Don't drink it if you don't want to.
At least talk politely.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.840
Mahi!

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.800
If you don't talk politely
to the one you love..

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.480
..they tend to get angry like this.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.840
Understood?

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.560
You must talk to them rudely.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.320
So that the only one left in
your life is the one you love.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.640
All hail mother Sita.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.160
I knew you will come back.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.880
Now go and work properly.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.000
Go on.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.120
How are you, Pooja?

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.160
I am young.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.760
You think about yourself, old freak.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.000
I am of your daughter's age.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.320
You need to catch a breath
between two sentences.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.960
But you dwell in every breath I take.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.160
As for my age.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.560
A man can grow old, but not his heart.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.040
Your heart and mind
is filled with crap.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.840
When God was gifting brains,
were you cleaning the buffaloes?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.040
I am done singing for buffaloes.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.760
Now I want to sing
for my female friend.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.040
♪♪Since I saw...your rosy eyes...♪♪

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.480
Stop liking me.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.560
Men and women have the same heart.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.720
And sometimes even men
have a heart like women.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.800
That heart is what this Roma has.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.840
You know, when I was in
trouble you took care of me.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.520
But seems like you're
in some kind of trouble.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.800
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.160
Even your mother couldn't
take care of you, bloody..

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.880
She's been wandering
from pillar to post.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.800
I know lovers like you too well.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.160
Stop this fake pretence.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.560
Forget about marrying you, I wouldn't
even invite you to my birthday.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.920
You sound so sweet
even when you're angry.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.680
What are you worried about?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.960
I am the one who is
sick and you sound tensed.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160
What do you want, just tell me?

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.440
You stop talking.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.680
Your pathetic poetry..

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.000
A cheap poet who can't
even get his nuances right.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.560
Utter another word
and I'll sic my dog on you.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.640
Your love has turned me into a dog.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.720
And if you don't believe me,
then listen to this..

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.360
Stop barking over the phone.
We couldn't find your motorcycle.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.920
The guy's been bugging me.
Keeps calling me every day.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.360
You mean..they loved the
way you were rude with them.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.280
Yes.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.040
This was inevitable.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.080
After all Pooja is the best.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.400
Honestly, sometimes I think
of drunk dialling you myself.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.800
Get lost.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.600
I don't know what to do.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.080
Who is it now..

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.680
Who is it now..

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.880
Hello, uncle.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.280
What's wrong?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.640
Well..is your girlfriend
in there with you again?

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.480
Yes. I haven't bought a mattress yet.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.520
You don't say.
Open up.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.600
They are coming in.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.720
Listen to me once..

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.400
Where do you think you are going?
Listen to me.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.440
How dare you lie?
Where is your girlfriend?

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.720
Sir, these days boys also..

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.160
Hey, constable..what..

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.120
Get out. How dare you come in?

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.080
When we want to shut
down something permanently..

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.240
..we get to the root of it.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.280
Understand.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.160
Surgical strike!

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.560
Love you sir.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.880
- What's wrong?
- I want to kiss you.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.400
As I said, these days even boys..

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.960
It is true, bro..

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.080
Shut it down! Let's go.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.920
This guy has given me a great idea?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.760
When you want to shut
down something permanently..

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.520
..get to the root of it.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.320
Get wherever you want.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.520
I am sober again.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.760
Hang up now.
I don't want any credit card.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.200
Who are you? What do you want?

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.360
Are you Chandrakanta Chaudhary Kirar?

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.280
Yes. Why?

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360
All yours?

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.080
No. Chaudhary Kirar's
your mom and I am Chandrakanta.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.400
How dare you come in without asking?
Who are you?

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.160
- Now, I get it..
- What?

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.440
Who is the inspiration
for Rajpal sir's poetry?

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.160
Who?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.680
You are.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.080
Me..

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.560
You two just got married, didn't you?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.560
It's been 10 years.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.880
10 Years!

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.600
And yet you have
that glow on your face.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.880
But after she has kids, there
will be no glow left.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.240
- We have a 9-year-old kid!
- Seriously!

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.040
Yes.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.000
You look like one of those
moms from the TV commercial.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.440
- Soap Commercial?
- Yes.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.840
Pray that this glow stays intact.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.600
We almost forgot..

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.440
Rajpal sir has sent these for you.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.400
Deodorant. Bouquet.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.640
Heart-shaped cake.
All these gifts are for you.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.440
It's an apology.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.000
Well...

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.600
All this is for me.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.120
Why would he give these to us?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.240
He never gave me anything
in all these years.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.080
He's a cop,
after all, they are never on time.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.200
He's got an entire city to look after.
Keeps him busy.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.760
He loves you alot, just doesn't show.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.600
Whenever he comes home..

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.680
..give him a tight hug.
And talk to him with a smile.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960
See you.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.680
Do what it takes..

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.520
..but you must take
the law in your hands.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.600
Okay.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.240
You're out of your mind.
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.440
Look at you now.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.880
Stop being so crazy after her.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.480
Papa, I am in no mood
for a lecture right now.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080
Please talk softly.
- Okay.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.120
- Son..
- Leave. I need to rest.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.160
I'll find out who this Pooja is.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.280
Once I get my hands on that Pooja..

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.720
Where are you? Walk quickly.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.080
Wake up..you poor Justin Beiber.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.160
Talk softly..he's just
got out of an ear surgery.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.360
Does Uncle have piles?

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.040
She said ears.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.720
Who are you two?

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.440
How dare you talk
back to Pooja's brother?

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.640
So you're that spoilt brat Toto!

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.480
Bro, Silence.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.440
- So you're that spoilt brat Toto.
- Yes..

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.640
Slit your wrist for nothing.
Let me show you then..

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.800
No, no, no, no, don't kill him.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.720
- Silence.
- Don't hit him

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.160
We'll hack you to pieces.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.560
What the hell is this?

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.640
- Trying to be Pooja's die-hard fan.
- He is just a kid.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.080
What kid? He's got more
hairs on his chest than you do.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.040
Oh that is alot of hairs.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.040
Where we come from, Even the
husbands don't tease their wife.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.040
And you think you can tease her.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.920
This is not teasing, I love her.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.200
The entire neighbourhood loves her.
Should I let her marry everyone?

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.920
I know she is shameless, she
talks dirty on the phone.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.640
- But she is my sister!
- Silence.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.320
But she is my sister!

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.760
Swear on Sita Maiya..

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.480
..I'll first hack my sister,
and then her lover boy.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.080
- What is this?
- Silence.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.320
Oh, God.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.960
Wait, little Singham.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040
Where are you going?

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.400
To get chocolates, papa.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.240
You always want Chocolate.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.200
- Here you go.
- But I already have one.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.440
What the..

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.480
Who gave you this much money?

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.640
Mom.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.720
Two strangers came over and
mom seems very happy since.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.640
Go..

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.840
Two strangers.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.920
How am I looking?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.800
Like a broken beer bottle.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.800
Really?

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.400
Who brought these gifts?

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.880
Don't try to pretend
like you don't know.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.440
Someone sent these..

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.040
Who?

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.120
My lover..

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.200
What?

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.960
So this has been
going on behind my back.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.480
And for how long?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.560
Gifts and cash.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.760
- What are you saying?
- Don't try to change the subject.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.400
What?
You sent these for me.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.760
Cops don't bribe others,
its what makes them cops.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.520
Wait a minute.
There must be sweets in this.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.560
- It's a cake..
- Point proved.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.960
I didn't send these.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.520
Policeman are getting
robbed in broad daylight.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.080
Mind your tongue..
Don't make me angry.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.240
How angry can you get 3-4 feet?

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.400
- And what can you do?
- What can I do?

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.320
- First, you send these gifts, and now..
- What can I do?

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.560
You have lost your mind.
I don't want to stay with you.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.720
- You can keep these. Get lost.
- Go.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.000
I am going to marry my Pooja.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.280
Pooja darling, pick up the phone.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.120
Hello.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.840
Hello, Pooja.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.720
Pooja.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.200
Hello..

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.320
Hello.. Hello, Pooja.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.800
No one's speaking here or here.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.400
None of them are speaking.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.720
What are you doing here?

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.920
Your new mom isn't answering her phone.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And someone's been calling
on your number constantly.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080
Fine. Now go.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.560
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja. This is Rahul.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.280
Why weren't you answering the phone?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.720
I was bathing.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.840
Alone?

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.440
No. I bathe with the
entire neighbourhood.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.680
I wish I lived in your
neighbourhood as well.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.280
You will, soon.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.480
You wanted to meet, didn't you?

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.800
Yes. When?

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.200
Today evening at 7.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.360
6:30..I'll be there at 6:30.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.080
Trust me. I'll be there at 6:30.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.080
Love you!

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.440
Love you.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.520
Love you.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.800
If you say that,
I'll be there by 5:45..

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.240
Karam..
- Yes.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.280
Son, Pooja your future mother..
she called me for a meeting.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.160
Please come with me.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.680
I am not going anywhere.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.600
You are still angry with me.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.160
Wait.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.040
I gave it a lot of thought.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.680
I approve of your marriage.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.680
Son, will you come with me.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.720
I would, papa.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.640
But since it's your first meeting..

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.000
..she might change her mind looking at
an old husband and a contemprary son.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.680
Go alone.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.360
Son..you take such good care of me.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.960
I wish..

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.880
Enough.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.400
Don't let love drive you crazy,
Jagjeet.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.880
Congratulations, grandma.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.600
Congratulations, grandma.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.000
- Congratulations.
- Bless me grandma.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.680
Congratulations, son.
Congratulations.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760
Congratulations for what, son.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.000
Smoking is injurious to health.
Leave it.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.120
Try this.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.400
I'll make a drink for you, grandma.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.200
Son, this brings back old memories.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.520
I used to sneak a few drinks
when Babu was still alive.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.080
Babu, Shona, huh!

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.200
Still young at heart, huh!

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.760
Your grandpa's name was Babu Lal.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.440
Oh..that way.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.400
Congratulations for what?
You were congratulating for something.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.240
Mahinder's marriage has been fixed.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.960
Mahinder's getting married?

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.400
Without telling me?

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.920
You don't know?

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.920
You're the oldest living
being in this city..

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.520
.. you deserve to know.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.600
But why should he?
The wedding date isn't fixed.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.560
And who knows if grandma
will still be around.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640
Not to mention one
less plate at the banquet.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.040
How much do you think grandma would eat
with no teeth.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.280
Correct.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.840
It's rude to say such
things about any girl..

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.120
..but its someone called
Pooja who talks dirty on the phone..

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.760
..with every Tom-Dick-and-Harry.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.320
Name is Pooja..and Dirty Talks..

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.680
Grandma..talking dirty..phone-a-friend!

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.520
Dirty talking.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.760
Come here, grandma.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.640
Swear on you..at least
a dozen guys are after her.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.480
If she comes here, then Mahinder
as well as Deepak will be happy.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.080
Why Deepak?

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.160
Out of the dozen
guys chasing her..

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.120
..Deepak is in the first one.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.480
He is a total rascal.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.840
Imagine the type of girl
she is and what her character is.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.840
Grandma..

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.200
Mahi will settle down with me.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.760
But when that girl
comes to this house..

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.440
- ..will she really look after you?
- No, she won't.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.760
- Will she respect you?
- Never.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.360
Not even a minute.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.200

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.800
I mean hello, grandma.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.680
God bless you, dear.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.960
What are you doing?

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040
Watering the plants.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.440
- At this hour?
- Yes.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.600
- Let me also talk to her.
- Yes, dear.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.120
Hello..sister-in-law.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.400
This is Mahi.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.000
Hi.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.880
Your sister-in-law.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.400
- Hi!
- Brother told grandma everything.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.800
And grandma has agreed
for this marriage.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.640
Since you're watering
your plants, dear, water mine too.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.920
Does everyone in
your house have separate plants?

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:51.920
Yes.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.400
I'll talk to you later.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.600
Papa is calling.

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.960
Okay, bye.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.160
Go and get more water
for papa's plants.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.320
Mahinder told everything to her.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.560
By the way, who told you such
negative things about her?

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.280
Right?

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.880
I just can't remember
who was the one.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.080
What happened?
Water..

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.120
Water..

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.640
Fathers are so unique.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.920
Your father is one in a million.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.080
Sometimes I wonder..

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.640
..how he spent a lifetime alone

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.240
And look at us..

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.440
Whenever we are tensed..

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.960
..we start drinking.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.800
And look at this man.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.160
No cigarette, or alcohol.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.920
In fact, even if he's ever
had a problem in life..

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.200
..he hasn't even told me about it.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.360
Not to mention that
I have caused him so much pain.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.080
You're right.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.880
He's always scolded me.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.080
But I never felt bad.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:15.960
I swear..

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.720
We will apologise.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.480
Wake up.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.960
Move.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.080
Try harder.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.040
Listen, Uncle..

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.680
Hello..

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.360
Waah..

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.640
Papa, it's you.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.440
From Jagjeet Singh to Mehendi Hassan.

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.160
Love is responsible for this makeover.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.760
You gave a complete makeover
to yourself and our ancestral shop.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.200
Feels like happiness
has entered my life.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.920
And no more selling
funeral items and caskets..

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.440
..instead your Abba will
promote beautiful lovely items.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.320
Who Abba?

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.000
Me of course.

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:36.600
Your Abba.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:40.720
That night I had an epiphany..

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.600
..and I changed for good.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.600
And Ismail has the biggest
contribution in this changeover.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:49.840
Ismail?

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.520
No, uncle, Smiley.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.120
Take the 'e' out..so Ismail.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.840
But why paint the house again.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:58.920
We just got it painted on Diwali.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.920
But Eid's coming up, son.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Our Eid?

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:02.880
Yes..

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.800
As you said, millions
of goats are sacrificed on Eid.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.120
One more won't make a difference.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.040
Look there.
See that..

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.400
I've even installed a stanchion
for the goat.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.320
And son, don't forget
to bring Sakeena over for Eid.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.520
Of course.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.040
Who is that?

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.840
You're fiancé.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.400
Fiancé.. Sakeena?

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.640
- But she can't come over, uncle.
- Why?

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.920
She has gone for Hajj to Patiala.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.200
To Patiala for Hajj?

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.320
I mean her aunt and
uncle live in Patiala.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.480
- She will meet them first
and then leave for Hajj. - I see..

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.760
Wonderful. Wonderful.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.720
Uncle, why are you speaking in Urdu?

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.520
Ignorant.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.200
Fix your pronunciation.
It's Urdu.

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:55.280
And Urdu is one of the
finest and smooth language.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.280
And listen.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.440
And on that note here
a few lines from a poet..

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.880
♪♪I can spend from dawn to dusk
under the refuge of your tresses.♪♪

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.600
♪♪I'll do my duties in this lifetime.♪♪

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.360
♪♪If you lock eyes with me,
I'll ask for the consequences.♪♪

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.720
♪♪And if you skirt eyes,
I'll just greet you.♪♪

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.200
Nice. Nice.
But I didn't get it, uncle.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.280
I didn't either.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.320
What are these bricks for?

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.960
Well, son, I am not a Shahjahan
to build another Taj Mahal.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.480
And your future mother
has a dozen siblings.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.840
So I am making four tombs
up there for her siblings.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.720
- You mean rooms.
- Exactly.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.160
Come Ismail, let me show you.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.960
Take a look. See..

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.440
This is where the rooms
are being constructed.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.000
- They are making the rooms right now.
- Great.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.400
My new family will
also stay here with me.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.000
And my wife.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.880
What happened, uncle?
Are you all right?

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.680
My heart skips a beat
whenever I think of her.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.720
She has a mesmerising
and enchanting voice.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.440
- Really?
- Yes, son.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.720
Greetings.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:04.800
Yes.

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.040
Mind your own business.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.640
I just wanted to say..

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.400
..that I am ready
to get married to you.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.840
You know what, send your
father over to fix a wedding date.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.320
My father's out of his limits?

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.720
Crossing his limits or
crossing borders for Hajj?

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.680
My father is crossing his limits.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.000
Fine, send him over when he returns.

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.760
My son's good friend
Ismail is right here with me.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.360
He is like a kid.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.800
I'll give my greetings to her.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.560
Hello, mammi aunty.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.960
Hang up.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.080
This Jagjeet has lost his mind.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.520
The changes that your
father is going through.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.080
You will repent one day.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.320
Be careful.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.760
Time is so bad, even a dog's
bark sounds like advice to me.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.840
You know,
people like to take a flying arrow..

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.920
..but you've taken a spear.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.640
Your beloved father is
in full mood to get married.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.960
She was the one missing.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040
Roma.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.440
Hello. How are you doing?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.520
What's the matter?
You seem to be in a great mood today?

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.800
yes, there is good news sister.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.040
Good news?

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.240
Yes. I am getting
married to my boyfriend.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.520
What?

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.760
This might be good news for you,
but not for me.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:28.840
Listen..

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.720
- Sign.
- Move.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.360
You know that all men are dogs.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.760
No, no, my boyfriend is not a dog.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.880
He is so naive that he
still smooches me on my head.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.360
All men pretend to
be naive in the beginning.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.480
I don't want anyone to ruin your life.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.080
Pooja, I don't care if we meet up or
not, but I want to meet up with Anurag.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.560
But why meet up.
You can talk to him on the phone.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.600
Anu baby..

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.960
Yes, Pooja.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.480
No. Not on the phone.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.120
Everyone sounds sweet
to me over the phone.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.200
Tell him I want to meet him tomorrow.
I'll text you the time and place.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.320
And listen.
Try to come over if you can.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.320
Hear me out first..

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.280
She has called Pooja's
boyfriend for a meeting.

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.160
Happy birthday.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.400
Firstly a woman, secondly
experienced..

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.880
And thirdly a news reporter
and fourthly she is very clever.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.640
From where you'll get
Pooja's boyfriend. Online

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.320
You are dead man.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.520
Let's go fast.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.800
Let's go. Have fun.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.360
Hey stop! Over there,
that is Pooja's brother.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.280
Hey move!

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.320
So, where did you meet
Pooja for the first time?

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.920
We used to speak on the phone.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.760
And liked the voice very much...

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.160
Her voice is mesmerising.

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.400
No..she liked my voice very much.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:59.720
And who proposed whom?

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.080
As you can guess from the face,
she did.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.680
But please don't tell her this.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.320
Ohh..sorry.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.840
You came to show
off how decent you are.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.920
Oh no, I don't drink, I never smoked.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.800
Shall I order juice instead?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.320
Hmm?..

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.360
Bloody uncool sh**

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.400
Will you judge my decency
by whether I drink or not.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.760
In that case,
you're completely spoiled.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.400
Smoking and drinking
can be bad habits..

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.880
..but not signs of
a bad character, ma'am.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.320
How dare you?

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.320
Is this a way you talk to a woman?

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.040
I am calling Pooja right now.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.040
Wait!

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.480
Call her.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.360
Yes, I am calling her..

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.040
I will show you.

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.880
How was Anurag?

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.800
Don't mind if he gets a little angry.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.640
He looks cute even
when he loses his temper.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.040
I knew it.
You will like her too.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.160
- I am so lucky.
- Pooja...

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.640
Happy?

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.600
The right one is with good intentions.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.320
And yes..your whiskey
was way more classy than you are.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.320
And don't forget.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.360
I love Pooja.

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:49.200
And I will marry her.
Will give her my everything. Okay.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.840
Radhe-Radhe!

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:54.960
Who is she?

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040
- This place isn't for you.
- But why?

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.040
- What are you doing here?
- Shopping.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.120
Of all the places..

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.080
Karam.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.360
Mahi. What are you doing here?

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.680
Shopping.

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.840
What are you doing here?

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.760
I came here for a meeting.
Let's go.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.240
Oh my, God.

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.880
So you are Pooja.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.960
Hi. Roma.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.040
I am not Pooja. I am Mahi.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.000
His future wife.

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.120
What?

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.000
Bloody two-timer.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.600
You're either cheating on Pooja or her?

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.160
- She is drunk.
- What?

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.680
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.480
She can't talk nonsense
even if she is drunk.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.800
What do you mean?

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.440
This man is a fraud and a cheat.

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.880
He came to meet me
as Pooja's boyfriend.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.120
Which Pooja are you talking about?

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.480
She's my phone-a-friend.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.640
That Pooja.
But I love her.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.680
Mahi.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.680
What?

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.600
But Pooja said she loves Anurag.

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.760
I see..
Now, who is this Anurag?

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.120
This Anurag.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.880
She is definitely high.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.480
You are mistaken.
He is not Anurag. He is Karam.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.360
Yes.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.760
He is no Karam. This guy's Anurag.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.600
She is lying. She is lying.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.840
Let's go, Mahi.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.360
If she's lying, Karam,
then why don't you tell us the truth.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.920
It's a long story, Mahi.
I'll tell you sometime later.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.960
Tell me now, Karam.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.400
- I'll tell you some other day..
- You must clear everything right now!

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.120
You are lying.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:23.920
Roma.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:24.880
Pooja.
What's the name.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.680
- Mahi. Listen to me.
- Brother-in-law.

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.720
This is completely unfair.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.480
- You screwed both of us.
- Get lost.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.320
You get lost.

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.240
Move, please.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.920
Mahi. Mahi, listen to me.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.960
Wait. Where are you going?

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.040
Give me a chance to explain.
Please..

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.920
- Hello, bro..
- Get lost.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.360
I am in a bad mood.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.760
Ohh, don't spoil my mood.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.760
I meant I am already in a bad mood,
you don't have to spoil yours.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.000
Please tell me honestly.
How do you know Pooja?

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:51.520
I love Pooja.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.960
How can you love her?

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.120
I love Pooja..sister.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.080
What sister?

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.080
The other day you were trying to be so
sturdy. But now you're being so mellow.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.880
You know what he was saying.
He'll hack me to pieces.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.320
- Beat him.
- Beat me.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.160
Come on, beat me. There my
sister Pooja's husband is beating her.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.440
You beat me.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.680
- Pooja's husband?
- Yes.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.840
He's a pain in the neck.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.960
Pooja never told
me that she is married.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.040
How could she?
His demands never end.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.400
Save her, brother-in-law.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.160
- Brother-in-law?
- Yes.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.240
Now we are family. Don't worry.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.680
I'll show you how
Gujjar's batter.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.640
This is your brother-in-law's promise.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.240
- Come on.
- Yes, come on.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.360
How dare he touch my Pooja.

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.400
Don't come any closer.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.200
Don't..or else I will kill you.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.440
Kill her.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.520
Wiseguy..how dare you touch my Pooja.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.320
Your Pooja.

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.360
What is he saying, sister?

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.120
Beat him.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.480
What beat him?
Let's talk.

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.920
- Wait. How was the recording?
- Don't ask.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.240
Rickshaw.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.760
- But what happened?
- No one's stopping.

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.640
I'll tell you later.
Rickshaw.

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.000
Rickshaw.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.320
- Where are you going?
- Wait a minute.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.440
- Where is sister-in-law?
- She is at home.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:59.720
Order's cancelled.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.960
Rickshaw.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.160
Wait. I have my own bike.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920
There she is.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.680
Mahi.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.920
Stay with her.
This is not a race.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.320
Wait a minute.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.640
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.240
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.720
What do you want?
- Save me, sister.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.600
No need to worry. I am here now.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.120
Mahi. Mahi, wait.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.800
Listen to me, Mahi.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.040
Lower that volume.

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.080
It's Daler Mehndi,
he sings this loud even in low volumes.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.240
Then turn it off.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.400
Mahi, listen.
Listen to me, Mahi.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.880
Just listen to me.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.400
Listen to what, Karam.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.000
And who are you?

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.320
It's me..Toto.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.760
We used to romance over the phone.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.640
I even made a tattoo of your name.
Pujja.

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.640
My name is Roma.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.480
And the spelling is wrong.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.280
But my love is real.

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.520
If you love someone else
then why are you marrying me?

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.080
Mahi, I only love
you and not some Pooja.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.480
But you couldn't say
this in front of that girl.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.560
I had imagined so many
things about you, Karam.

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.160
And you are still lying to me.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.240
What is the confusion?

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.880
You say that you love Pooja.
So does he.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.280
Even I love her.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.640
Who is Pooja?

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.120
And why is everyone taking her name?

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.280
Oh, God. And you think
I have an affair with her.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.960
Yes. I do.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.640
Mahi.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.040
Mahi, wait.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.240
I don't understand one thing.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.240
You sound so sweet over the phone.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:30.280
But in reality, you sound a bit hoarse.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.040
You think I sound hoarse.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.640
I said I am not Pooja.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.800
Save me. Save me.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.480
Catch him.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.480
This way..

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:42.880
Come on.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.760
Catch him.

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.320
What is this Pooja's matter?

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.200
Step on it, man.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.560
Pooja. That Anurag is a fraud.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.600
Curse you.
Trying to ruin people's lives.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.240
Bloody drunk woman. Hang up.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.360
Who was that?

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.080
- Mahi. Just listen to me.
- No, Karam.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.800
Fine, Then here is the truth.

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.400
I love Pooja.

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.880
I love her and we're one.
One heart and soul.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.200
- Stop the rickshaw.
- You too.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.440
- What did you say?
- I love you.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.440
Pooja and I are one heart and soul.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Pooja is that lovely.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.240
Not just me.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.120
Your brother Mahinder as well as
your father-in-law love her a lot.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.280
What?

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.560
I do. I do. I do.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.240
The marriage gets solomonized
if you repeat it three times.

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.920
I'll say it again louder.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.120
Do you want the entire city to hear?

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.880
If you use up all your
strength at the wedding..

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.640
..then what will you
do on your wedding night?

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.520
Payal, Pankhudi, Jyoti, Yasmeen..

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.800
Where is Pooja, Karam?

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:51.960
Pooja.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.200
Pooja's here too.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.240
Where, Karam?

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.040
Karam?

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.680
Karam?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.160
Hello. Pooja speaking.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.560
How are you?

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.600
I am fine.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.760
I'll call you later. Please.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.880
Okay, bye. Love you, take care.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.400
Karam is Pooja.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.400
Pooja who cannot exist without Karam.

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.760
And Karam not without you.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.640
Why didn't you tell me before?

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.600
No job, and debts to pay.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360
Even I am in love with this Pooja.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.920
Hi, Pooja baby..

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.800
'The work that isn't getting
done...something something...'

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.040
This is Mahi. My fiancé.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.120
Ohh..

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.920
She came to see Pooja.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.400
You told her everything.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:17.760
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.560
This is Mr. W.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.240
He runs this call centre.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.200
He came into my life as a guide
but soon turned selfish.

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:32.160
He threatened to expose me if I quit.

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.480
No.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.640
You are a scum.

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.280
You should be grateful to everyone
here, who is a breadwinner for you.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.440
What are you without them?

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.680
You sound better than him.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.720
If you're under some kind of debt,
I'll clear it for you.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.600
You..

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.640
Don't forget.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.480
Pooja is a man.

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.000
Pooja!

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.760
Karam. Karam.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.160
Where are you hiding?

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.640
Green house.
I think I am in the wrong house.

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.240
Mahinder. Greetings.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.760
How is everyone?

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.400
Didn't you recognise me?

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.920
It's Jagjeet. Uncle Jagjeet.

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.080
Radhe-Radhe Uncle.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.120
Hello.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.080
What happened to you?

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.320
Forget about me, what happened to you?

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.280
Nothing, uncle. I had a fight.

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.440
Sorry to tell you son,
but you got beaten up.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.560
Yes, that.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.640
- What happened?
- I am being wronged.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.480
What happened?

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.680
You are so decent and your
son Karam's completely opposite.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.760
What did he do now?

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.400
The girl I love and want to marry..

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.960
- ..he is chasing after her.
- What?

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.920
There's someone else
in his life other than Mahi.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:19.760
Yes, uncle.

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.520
Who?

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.160
Her name is Pooja.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.040
Pooja who?

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.760
A girl with whom I fell in love
while talking on the phone.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.240
- Phone-a-friend Pooja?
- Yes.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.760
My Pooja.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.120
Exclaims.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.640
My son Karam is romancing
his future mother.

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.320
Future mother.
What nonsense.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.960
It's not nonsense.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.040
I am in love with her.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.440
I am madly in love with her.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:50.240
And her real name isn't Pooja,
her name is Zubeida.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.600
Radhe-Radhe! What a shameless family.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.280
- What shameless.
- Father and son after the same girl.

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.120
Mahinder. Mahinder.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.000
Uncle, they are the
guys that beat me up.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:59.320
Who are you?

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.200
Your wedding hasn't been fixed yet..

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.800
..and your family members
are already showing up.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.280
Uncle, I am not his family.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.640
I am Pooja's future husband.

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.240
- Huh..
- Allah..what kind of a woman is she?

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.920
She has entraped every variety of
man.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.160
Except for me.

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.240
- Hey, Priest..don't provoke me.
- Get lost.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:21.000
- Pooja is only mine.
- Hey..

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.560
If anyone comes between
Pooja and me then I will kill him.

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.720
But son, Zubeida is mine.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.120
- Zubeida who?
- I am leaving.

01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.840
- Stay seated.
- But I have to pee.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.480
Hold it.

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.760
Where on earth did you come from?
Who are you?

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.320
- I am here for the wedding.
- Here..

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.280
Another one..

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.200
I can control my pee..

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.480
..but someone control that woman.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.880
That woman has more lovers..

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.920
..than we have devotees in the mosque.

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.360
By wedding I mean..

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.520
..Karam called me over to
collect advance for the wedding.

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.520
Are you going to play
that DJ at his funeral?

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.080
- What nonsense.
- Advance.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.320
Get lost. Boys beat him up.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.480
Uncle, we dealt with him.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.360
- Now I will deal with your son.
- No?

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.720
You won't lay a finger on my son.

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.560
I will deal with my son.

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:11.280
He betrayed his own father.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.800
And romancing with his future mother.
Romancing with his future mother.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.680
I swear I won't spare him.

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.840
He betrayed his father.

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.760
Mahi, this pretending to be Pooja,
the job at the call centre..

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.360
Was I wrong?

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.320
I once heard someone say..

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.880
The right one is with good intentions.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.800
Don't think about any of this.

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.440
Krishna Leela is today right?.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.920
I want to see how my Krishna
looks when dressed like Radha.

- Move from here

01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.760
Get lost.

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.200
Out. Out.

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.880
The show's over. The show's over.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.080
Stop this charade. Stop it!

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.040
How dare you touch our Karam?

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:08.880
Our Radha?

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.040
This Radha is not
worthy of your respect!

01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.760
If you weren't portraying Radha..

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.640
..I would've turned
this place into your grave.

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.800
Hold on.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.680
Tell me what has he done.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.920
Murder.

01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:23.800
- Murder?
- Murder?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.360
Yes...My Pooja's murder.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.360
Uncle.

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.640
And this man must have told you this.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.080
Karam can never kill Pooja.

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.240
He is lying.

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:37.240
It's not a lie.
I am sure he killed Pooja.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.480
He came to the hospital to threaten me.

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.160
And he claimed that
he will hack Pooja to pieces.

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.320
Come on.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.680
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.080
To destroy myself..in love.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.600
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.760
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.360
How do you know this poetry?

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.800
Only Pooja and I know about it.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.440
Even I knew Pooja.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.320
She was very nice.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.240
Where did he go?

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.360
Where did he go?

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.920
- Catch him.
- Don't let him go.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.200
Check there.

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.600
- Catch him.
- I won't run!

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:28.360
Even I loved Pooja.

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.200
Then why did you kill her?

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.280
If I can create her,
then I can kill her.

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:43.800
This little bundle of joy and
a great friend had to die one day.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.040
She could easily win over people.

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.440
When Pooja used to say..

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.600
♪♪Hello..♪♪

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.800
♪♪Pooja speaking.♪♪

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.720
I am Pooja.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.840
When I got talking to people,
I realised..

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:18.080
..that our population might be
increasing, but so is loneliness.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.160
Today we have thousands of friends
over Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:25.560
But do you have one
true friend in real life?

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.480
Someone who can listen to you,
understand you?

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.760
And this loneliness
has increased to an extent..

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.560
..that no one bothers
to take a family picture.

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.960
Everyone's only worried about selfies.

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:47.040
And for these lonely people,
along came..

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.800
..this Pooja.

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:52.760
While talking to people
I gradually understood..

01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:58.280
..that every person
in this world needs Pooja.

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.440
And Pooja is not a gender.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.800
Anyone like your friends,
family, relatives, wife, children..

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.680
Anyone can be your Pooja.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.760
Someone you can open your heart to.

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:19.720
Someone who can make you
realise that you are not alone.

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.480
And the day you find your Pooja..

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.280
..you won't need some
phone-a-friend Pooja anymore.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.880
Now, do all of you
know the truth of Pooja?

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.440
Now, what is Mr. W's truth?

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.680
He will only be able
to tell us where Pooja is.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.040
I just did. He must have killed her.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.040
Leave me. -Come on
-Leave me.

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.400
She is the real Pooja.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:56.120
Tell them. Tell them the truth.

01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.760
I am Pooja.

01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.320
And Mr. W paid me to do this.

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.040
You bloody..

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:08.320
Trying to make a fool out of me,
are you?

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:11.600
Arrest him. Take him away.

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.040
Let's go.

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.280
I have a question.

01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.480
Are you Pooja?

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:30.400
Yes.

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.560
Marry me.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.760
Here.

01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:34.680
Rajpal Kirar.

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.040
You think your wife's too short.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.760
You should be thankful
that you got married.

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.600
- Really?
- No romance at home.

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:40.640
Always arguing.

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:43.440
If you stay out all night working,
then where will the romance come from.

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:45.880
My sweet naive Mahinder.

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:49.000
- Come here, my super singer.
- Hey Brother-in-law, listen to me.

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.280
Marry me. Marry me.
- No..No

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.080
- Trying to woo girls with your voice.
- No.

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.680
If a good voice was
enough to woo girls..

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.200
..then no singer would
ever focus on singing.

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.160
- I made a mistake sorry..
- Maary me come on.

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:00.560
Toto..where are you going?

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:05.800
You know those sweet messages
children write on wedding cards.

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.960
You're even younger than those kids.

02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:09.320
Minor

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.440
Ma'am. You've lost faith in men.

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:18.080
Just because you had three bad bananas,
you want to crush the entire bunch.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.360
You should be ashamed.

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.880
All of you should be ashamed.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.720
To become crazy about my innocent son.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:26.880
Ignorants.

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.600
O Uncle.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:29.760
Yes.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.760
Papa aka Rahul aka
Jagjeet aka Mehendi Hassan.

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:35.600
Dreaming of a honeymoon
when you should be praying.

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:39.840
Son..i made a big mistake.

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:42.600
Swear on that benevolent Lord.

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:49.480
I had no clue that I was dreaming
about my own son to my bride.

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.040
Wow..
So strong Urdu vocabulary

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.120
I've been trying to teach this
man computers for past three years.

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.320
But he couldn't learn.

02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.440
But you learnt Urdu
for a girl in three days.

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.960
And he turned Mathura
into mini Karachi.

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.240
Marry me.

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.640
Marry me.
Who is it going to marry me?

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:07.160
Marry me.
Kirar sir. Marry me.

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.960
Marry me.
Madam, you marry me.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.560
- Who wants to marry me?
- I do.

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.920
I've been asking you
to marry me for so long.
