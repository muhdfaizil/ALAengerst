00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:29.690
SOME SCENES IN THE STORY TAKE PLACE IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF INDIA INCLUDING DELHI

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.391
BUT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE VIEWERS,
THE CHARACTERS COMMUNICATE IN TELUGU.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:52.513
Chennai Tower, this is Deccan Air 582.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.248
Minimum fuel.
Requesting landing clearance.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:56.817
Go around, Deccan Air 582.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.085
Unable to go around.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.621
I said we have a fuel emergency,
goddammit!

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.458
-I say again, Deccan Air 582--
-Why aren't you letting me land?

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.294
There's something wrong.
They are ignoring protocol.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:10.531
-Requesting reason for denial!
-You are not cleared to land!

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.834
-Why aren't you letting him land?-Who are you? Call the guards!

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.537
Maha? Maha, what's going on there?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.307
-Why aren't they permitting me to land?
-Che, Tambaram Air Force. Runway 1-5.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.676
Land there!
Do you have enough fuel for that?

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.111
There's enough fuel to land there.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.946
-You sure you want us to proceed?
-I'm sure.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:28.182
-It will be a problem, Maha.
-Land at Tambaram!

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.117
-I'll handle it!
-Roger.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:38.692
-Stop running.
-Che, come in.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.808
Parade!
Attention!

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.111
Keep going!
Careful!

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:00.480
Come in Tambaram Ground Control.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.516
This is Captain Chaitanya Rao,
batch of 1987.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:03.383
Please acknowledge.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.519
You don't have permission
to land here, Captain.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:08.522
This is military territory.
Turn around immediately! It's an order!

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.496
Come in, Che!

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.167
Careful.
You're flying into restricted area.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.268
It's dangerous!

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:25.672
Go. Go fast!

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.450
-Security breach at gate number one!
-Hey.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:37.784
-Stop, stop.
-Stop the vehicle.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.753
Shit, shit, shit.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.876
Che, are you okay!

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:04.978
Can you hear me, Che?

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.864
SURIYA

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:25.999
Che?

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:32.573
PARESH RAWAL

CO-STARRING
"PADMA SHRI" DR.MOHAN BABU.M

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.594
AAKAASAM NEE HADDHU RA!
[SKY IS YOUR LIMIT!]

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.180
How can you stuff yourself with meat
after a pilgrimage?

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:50.317
That chap's no longer in the army.
His relatives say he's unemployed.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:53.654
Why are you so hell-bent on meeting him?

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.490
-What's the big deal?
-It's unprecedented.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.759
It's unheard of for a girl's family
to visit a boy.

00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:02.429
He refused to see you!
Why are you dying to see him?

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.331
Look, she's eating shamelessly!

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:07.401
He refused to treat me
like an animal for sale

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.569
that's why we're going.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.205
She'll choose her husband
like Sita chose Lord Rama.

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.073
-Right, kiddo?
-Stop calling her kiddo.

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:15.742
You're spoiling this buffalo.
Stop taking her side.

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.846
Are you talking about me?
Am I really spoilt?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.349
I'm the only one in the family
to clear 12th grade in one go.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.185
You spent lakhs
to make this dimwit an engineer.

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:26.286
Don't drag me into this.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.422
They are spending a fortune on you.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.890
Shut her up, dad!

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:34.394
Listen girl,
only sons provide for parents.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.865
Daughters move in with their
husbands after marriage and enjoy life.

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:39.600
Move!
You and your pearls of wisdom!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.069
-Move aside!
-Do you get it, you witch?

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.470
Oh, my God!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.208
This is what happens if you open
your mouth unnecessarily.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:51.778
-Get your hands off me!
-I shouldn't have helped him!

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.547
Isn't this a reserved compartment?

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:56.583
What's that stench?
Dried fish? Yuck!

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:59.086
Well, you won't stop eating
once you taste this.

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.156
We will get off at Tsundur.
These seats will be all yours.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.293
This is express train.
It doesn't stop at Tsundur.

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:10.063
It does! For the last six months,
our boy has not let

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.833
a single train pass Tsundur
without stopping there.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.304
-That is Maha.
-Without so much as causing a ruckus!

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.741
So every time I travel to Vijayawada,
I've to deal with this crap?

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.977
You can keep these precious seats
all for yourself.

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.146
We won't be traveling
in trains anymore.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.447
Then how are you going to travel?

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:29.583
-We're going to fly!
-Fly?

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:31.652
-He's bringing a plane to us!
-Yes!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.654
-Who?
-Our Maha!

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.324
On this strange land

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:44.031
Brought to life by God
Behold the games of man

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:45.933
Behold the games

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:51.271
Behold man's mad games

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.042
On this round ball of dirt
Behold the strange game of man

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:58.612
When his eyelids last shut
He is but a procession on a hearse

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:02.149
Savor these sips of toddy

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:05.619
The one who's bathed
In toddy above is watching you

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:09.156
Rich or poor
All are dealt the same notch

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:12.793
In their final passage
all get blown the conch

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:16.363
Rich or poor,
all are dealt the same notch

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.700
On their final passage,
all get blown the conch

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:45.092
Evolved from apes we may have,
but our race saw no evolution

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.729
Behold our fate
Behold our ethics

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.232
Experience being a monkey
Its race and its ethics

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.334
Else, let it go and dance

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:58.005
Before the end of sweetness between us

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:01.441
This music can even raise the dead

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:05.112
The wraps come undone
when the drunks dance with joy

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:08.382
The wails of women light up and soar

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.785
Legions of near and dear
yet no one to tag along with him

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:15.556
Acres of lands were his
yet six feet of soil is what is

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:19.026
Legions of near and dear
yet no one to tag along with him

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:22.563
Acres of lands were his
yet six feet of soil is what is

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:27.801
The one dancing in the black shirt
is the groom.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.037
-What!
-What is he doing?

00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:33.774
The bride's family is here.
What are you doing?

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.877
-Did we come for this?
-This is humiliating.

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:38.312
They're staring at you.

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:39.947
Who cares?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.115
That man danced for every death here.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:45.085
The whole village
should dance on his death.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.788
-Come and dance!
-Alright. Let's rock it!

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.499
-God forbid she starts dancing!
-Stop it.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.002
Let's go.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:13.680
Rocks. Palm trees.
Barren lands.

00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:15.148
It'll all be your daughter's.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:18.652
Yeah right! The groom doesn't seem
interested in the marriage.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.922
Oh, no. He's keen too.

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.690
-Come on. Let's go inside.
-Come on!

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.158
Please have some fryums.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.863
Did we come all the way
to eat fryums?

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.799
Don't you have cakes?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.836
There's no toilet
how can they offer cakes?

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.838
Don't shush me.
It's the truth.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.706
Since we're talking truths,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.175
I'm completely broke.

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.977
I've a huge loan
and all I earn goes for repayment.

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:46.613
-Hey.
-No, he is just joking.

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:49.049
This land's worth a lot of money.

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:52.786
All I have is an idea
to start an airline.

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.088
But 24 banks have rejected it.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.156
Look, mister.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.393
Men are in a queue to marry
my beautiful and talented daughter.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.762
I've been rejected by 20 men
so far.

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.730
-Shh! Silly girl. Shut up.
-Why?

00:11:04.398 --> 00:11:09.903
I don't sew, cook, dance, or sing.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.372
Mr. Military! She's just pulling your leg.

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:15.409
-She knows all that and more, right?
-Ignore him.

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.445
But I won't do any of it.
I just want to start a bakery.

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:22.216
Now that they have blurted out the truth,
there's nothing to talk about.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.584
-Let's eat.
-Okay. Let's go.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.353
-Let's eat and call it a day.
-Wait a minute.

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:30.691
It's not our tradition to eat unless
the discussion is fruitful.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:33.894
And we don't let our guests go hungry.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.996
-Let's go and eat!
-What?

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.401
So your friend's bringing planes
to this village?

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:42.903
-Yeah, bro.
-Enough.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.371
Have you been on an airplane?

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:46.974
"Been on one"?
What are you talking?

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:50.377
I have a close friend who's a pilot.

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:53.213
He lets me drive when he gets tired.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.716
It is true, believe me.

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:58.185
How will you finance your airline?

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:01.288
Hey, that's grown-up talk.
Why are you asking about it?

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.623
That's why I'm asking.

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.625
Let her ask.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.994
So, 20 men rejected you?

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:11.665
Twenty four banks rejected you, right?
Can we talk about that?

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:13.166
They weren't that bright.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.735
Those men weren't either.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.005
One, two, three.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.842
Just three steps to start an airline!
Seems easy.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.077
Starting a bakery is easier.

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:25.979
Why haven't you done that yet?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.915
I'm stuck at step one.

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:31.418
Looking for finance.
I'm waiting for money.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.324
I know banks.
What is 'ven-tu-r capitalist'?

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.692
Venture Capitalist.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.628
Banks give loans against collateral.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.464
But for Venture Capitalist, VC

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:45.866
your idea is your collateral.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.535
You get funds if they like your idea.

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:49.903
Oh!

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:51.738
Then you must find a VC.

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:53.941
Who is that? A VC?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.510
-Did you like food?
-Yes, it is good.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.845
Paresh Goswami.

00:12:57.978 --> 00:12:59.546
He owns Jaz Airlines.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.983
He realized his dream
with little to no help.

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:04.318
My hero.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.856
With so many basic needs unfulfilled
in our country

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.524
who needs planes?

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.892
Stop talking like that.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.061
A century ago,
they said we don't need electricity.

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:16.330
Fifty years ago,
they said we don't need cars.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.031
-Who decides that?
-That is right.

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:19.633
The rich decide for the rest.

00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:22.970
-Forget it. You won't get it.
-Is it? Shut up and eat.

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:24.872
Okay.

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:27.007
Okay with what?

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.209
With marrying you.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.748
That was quick.
Are you insane?

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:39.253
Sometimes, no matter how hard we think,
we end up doing what we want.

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:41.555
-I don't like to waste time.
-That's Maha!

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:44.725
But I give enough thought
before making up my mind.

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:47.494
-There she goes.
- You'll know my decision in the morning.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:51.098
That's my girl! Eat, dear.

00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:01.441
You fussed about eating here.

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:04.778
But you missed the train
and has to stay back.

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:05.913
That is fate.

00:14:14.454 --> 00:14:15.422
That way.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.861
Hey!

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:24.731
You have a big house in the village.

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.634
Why do you stay in a place
where there's no electricity?

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.303
Getting electricity is no big deal.

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:32.105
Even teacher Rajaram's house
didn't have electricity 20 years ago.

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:33.540
With determination anything is possible.

00:14:33.607 --> 00:14:35.309
-Hey! Air India!
-Air India! Air India!

00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:36.577
-Air India!
-Where are you going?

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.278
I'm going to board Air India, Dad.

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:40.380
You want planes
when there are no roads?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.082
First, learn to cut hair!

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.985
Is it a law that a son must do
his father's trade?

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:47.588
No matter what they study,

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:50.290
it's their fate
to get into the family business?

00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:53.827
Keep the pot on your head, kid.
I'll do the rest in the morning.

00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.596
Dad, it would look awkward!

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.631
What if I cut off your ear
in the dark?

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.566
First make the train
stop at our village.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.269
Tsundur folks must go till Tenali
to take a train.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.572
My father, the six-fingered
school teacher,

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:09.610
wrote numerous letters to the government
to make the train stop here.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.678
How long will you keep writing?

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:13.680
As long as I can hold a pen.

00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:17.618
Politicians go around happily
in trains and planes!

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.287
Why would they care about us?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.258
The teacher kept writing petitions,
but nothing changed.

00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:26.360
I picked up a stone.

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:29.162
-Hear us, Central Government!
-Hear us, Central Government!

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:31.532
-Stop the express train here!
-Stop the express train here!

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.967
-Tsundur beseeches you!
-Tsundur beseeches you!

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:35.936
-Deceive us, no more!
-Deceive us, no more!

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.972
Down with police brutality!

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.774
We want the train to stop here.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.576
We want the train to stop here.

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:46.146
Stop it, stop it.
We want the train to stop here.

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:47.281
Stop the train here!

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:48.348
We want the train!

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.650
Stop it, stop it.

00:15:50.184 --> 00:15:50.851
Maha!

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:55.222
Kasi!

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:57.524
-Kasi?
-Maha.

00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:58.559
Take this.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:02.029
-I can't open my eye.
-You'll be fine! I'm here!

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:05.999
What happened?
Oh my god! You're bleeding!

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:10.337
Your son pelted stones
to stop the train at Tsundur.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.674
Kasi's badly injured.
He could have lost an eye.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.810
What? Is it true?
Come on in first.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.415
He would've been arrested!
They let him go because he's my son!

00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:25.219
But God, the way they looked at me.

00:16:25.853 --> 00:16:27.487
I was so ashamed!

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:30.357
The people of the village
honor my words,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.327
but my own son
doesn't listen to me.

00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:35.996
Dad, you've always said
time's precious.

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:39.166
And that the train stopping here
will change our lives.

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.035
You talk a lot about change.
Shouldn't I make it happen?

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.371
Hey, don't act like a stupid person.

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:46.373
Aren't you educated?
You're a teacher's son!

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.674
Stupid fellow.

00:16:47.808 --> 00:16:51.945
If you want the train to stop here,
you should write to the division head.

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.047
Do you get it?
Can you do that?

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:55.349
You wrote petitions.

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:56.583
-Maha? Maha?
-What happened?

00:16:56.717 --> 00:16:59.353
We got electricity because of that.
Get inside!

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:00.587
Not that petition, mom!

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:02.890
I know which petition
he's talking about.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:03.724
Let him talk.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.360
He hasn't eaten!

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.428
You know he blabbers
when he's hungry!

00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:12.733
-Come in.
-If he has the guts, let him say it!

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.968
First thing tomorrow,
I'll have him arrested.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:16.904
Don't say that.
He's our son!

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.306
What did you do when mom had
pregnancy complications?

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:22.576
You just sent petitions
asking for a medical camp!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.810
-You'll have me arrested?
-Hey.

00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:25.979
You should be arrested
for killing your child!

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.948
-Maha! Don't talk about it.
-Quiet, Mom!

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.384
Even now we took Kasi to town.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:33.554
This armchair idealist will bury us all
with his petitions!

00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:35.923
You're a bloody failure!
And will always be one!

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.292
Oh, my God!

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.527
What have you done? Maha...

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:44.264
If violence is wrong,
then why the hell did you just hit me?

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.933
Maha, mind your language.

00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:53.073
-Thanks for the lesson, son.
-Oh, God.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.776
Don't even light my pyre
when I die.

00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:57.678
-Listen to me.
-Leave!

00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:01.949
Maha!
What have you done?

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.984
Son, where are you going?

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:05.919
He's leaving!

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.889
Hey, Maha, don't go.
Where are you going?

00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:11.525
And then what happened?

00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:16.129
Then I joined the National Defense Academy
and then the Air Force.

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:17.798
Quite the angry man!

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.267
Were you as bad in the Air Force?

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:37.718
He says the snacks don't reach him.

00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:39.786
-All the postal guys...
-Aunt!

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:41.788
Show it to him.

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:43.557
-The postal guys eat them up.
-Maha has sent a letter.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.626
I'm sending two boxes this time!

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:47.794
With a note saying...

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:51.198
"You can take one box,
but give the other to my son."

00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:52.466
Get it here!

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:53.734
Should I read it out?

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:57.337
I am a third grader,
and a teacher's wife!

00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:58.839
I can read myself.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.474
Look at him writing chits.

00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.744
Writes letters for his son
and then hides them!

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:05.812
I will shred them one day!

00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.748
"Dear Mom."

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.483
Look! He's listening.

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:12.719
"And dear Kasi...

00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:14.521
Hope all is well.

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:17.057
I'm good here."

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:18.992
This shows how much he loves us.

00:19:19.092 --> 00:19:21.495
"I passed my ex-cams, Mom."

00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.764
-It's an 'exam', Aunt!
-That's what I said. Shut up!

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:26.266
"Chaitanya stood first.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.537
And I was second.
Seby stood fourth.

00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:36.176
I am a pilot officer
Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam now.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:20:00.200
There's an Officer called Naidu
who torments me with his rules

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:04.938
and tortures me with do's and don'ts,
just like our teacher!"

00:20:05.072 --> 00:20:06.807
Bring this stupid Naidu to me.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.710
I'm going to break his neck
like I do with chickens.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.447
Move round and round
Like a surging hurricane

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.084
Stomp over arrogance
Like a bull off its leash

00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:24.224
A streak like the lightning
Tear it all down

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:27.794
Punch it and spread it dry
Then, dust it off and toss it out

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.796
Sir!

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:42.276
Come on, trainees!
Double up!

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.810
Move fast, I say!

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.981
Kasi, I'm fine! How are you?
Where's mom?

00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:49.516
She's fine!

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.685
Get her quick!
I only have three minutes!

00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:54.021
She's bringing your father!

00:20:54.154 --> 00:20:56.523
She'll be here any second!
Hang on!

00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:58.258
She's here, Maha!

00:20:58.358 --> 00:20:59.826
Aunty, hurry up!

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.961
Ask them to hurry!

00:21:01.962 --> 00:21:03.964
His leg hurts.

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.599
-Here, Aunt!
-Give it to me.

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:07.434
Hello, Maha?

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:10.971
-Mom?
-Maha? Your dad's come.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.440
-Mom?-Shall I put him on, Maha.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.342
-Mom, I can hear you.
-Maha?

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:16.643
I can't hear anything.

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:17.978
I can hear you.
Please talk.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.213
Buddy?
Hello?

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:20.881
-Ask her to talk.-Can you hear me?

00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:22.649
-Hello!
-Give it to his dad!

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:24.618
-The line got disconnected!
-Oh, no.

00:21:25.652 --> 00:21:27.487
Kasi, I can hear you.
Give the receiver to dad.

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:29.890
Why will he talk to a failure?

00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:32.292
He won't talk to me.

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:34.561
What are you saying?
Hold him!

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:35.963
Hello. Mom!

00:21:36.063 --> 00:21:37.397
I'll just make one more call!

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.732
-Uncle?
-Please wait, dear.

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.000
-Chandra Mahesh?
-Sir!

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.502
People are waiting.

00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:43.470
Everyone gets only three minutes.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.073
Call next month!
Move! Move!

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:54.214
Logistically we can save a lot, sir.

00:21:54.348 --> 00:21:56.183
How will one MI-26 alone suffice?

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.784
Since it's a joint exercise
with army,

00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.987
we can transport airmen
in their armored troop carriers.

00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.388
One chopper will do.

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:03.390
We ration fuel
and cut extra costs.

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:05.058
You will cut down nothing, Chandra Mahesh.

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:07.227
Don't be stingy.

00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:08.362
Intelligence says,

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.664
the insurgent activity has risen
near the Sinhagad Fort.

00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:13.166
We eliminate risk by increasing
our ground numbers.

00:22:13.233 --> 00:22:14.001
And then we can go ahead, sir.

00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:16.170
It's not being stingy,
It's being smart, sir.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.506
-So... Chaitanya?
-Sir!

00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:21.041
Is he saying I'm dumb?

00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:21.875
No, sir!

00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:26.313
Fifty rounds around the parade ground!

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.615
Fifty kilos dead weight!

00:22:29.216 --> 00:22:30.751
Take your friends with you!

00:22:31.518 --> 00:22:35.222
Hundred rounds. Eighty kilos.
In one and a half hours.

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:35.956
Move!

00:22:58.679 --> 00:23:00.514
Baby, Baby? Hey, Baby?

00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:02.316
-Hey, get up!
-Hey.

00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:05.252
What are you doing with him
so late at night?

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:06.186
Get up!

00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:12.626
Like a churn
You shook up my heart

00:23:12.993 --> 00:23:18.165
Like in a war
You have shaken up my life

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:24.471
Like a pearl born in a shell
deep down in the ocean of milk

00:23:24.605 --> 00:23:30.244
Give me a few glimpses of your beauty
to make me desire for more

00:23:30.344 --> 00:23:31.879
You tigress!

00:23:33.447 --> 00:23:35.082
Oh, tigress

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.088
This boy is your bounty

00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:44.191
-Hey, Kasi!
-Yes, buddy?

00:23:48.929 --> 00:23:51.331
Why is she so mad?
You two were just talking, right?

00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:53.133
Why should I tell you?

00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:56.970
After so many rejections,

00:23:57.104 --> 00:24:00.974
I was scared,
my niece will remain a spinster.

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:04.545
This is an auspicious month.
Got to book a marriage hall soon!

00:24:04.678 --> 00:24:07.714
You brought it this far.
Excellent job!

00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:29.002
Over there.
He looks dashing, doesn't he?

00:24:33.073 --> 00:24:33.740
No.

00:24:34.174 --> 00:24:35.409
What the hell?

00:24:35.542 --> 00:24:38.245
Are you saying no
to the marriage in the hall?

00:24:38.378 --> 00:24:39.913
I am saying no to the marriage.

00:24:40.047 --> 00:24:42.883
The boy himself has agreed!
Why are you declining?

00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:44.985
Did you ask those 20 men
why they rejected me?

00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:46.486
-That's different!
-Shut up.

00:24:48.555 --> 00:24:49.456
May I ask why?

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.724
Yes! Yes you may!

00:24:52.092 --> 00:24:54.528
You're already married
to airplane!

00:24:55.095 --> 00:24:56.230
I'm married, too.

00:24:56.697 --> 00:24:59.666
Let's make something
out of that first.

00:25:00.868 --> 00:25:04.238
Serves you right for your arrogance.
The devil's just like you!

00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:07.508
No loss, buddy.
She looks like a bun, anyway.

00:25:07.608 --> 00:25:09.076
We can find someone better than her.

00:25:09.209 --> 00:25:12.513
Shut up.
I'm sure she has her reasons.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:13.247
Unbelievable.

00:25:14.515 --> 00:25:17.718
Hey broker,
I'll deal with you later.

00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:19.786
Did you bring us all the way to say no?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.255
-What's your problem?
-What is your problem!

00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:22.689
That I rejected him?

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:24.925
Or that you couldn't reject
your husband?

00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:26.660
He is a good guy.
You can't find anyone like him.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.195
-Drop them off.
-No way, buddy!

00:25:28.762 --> 00:25:29.930
Let them walk.

00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:34.067
It's a waste of fuel.
Hey, get into the vehicle.

00:25:35.903 --> 00:25:41.775
Wealth and festivities, you lured away

00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:47.114
I lay awake at nights
for you hacked away at my sleep

00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:53.120
My wings are caught in the storm

00:25:53.587 --> 00:25:59.593
You stirred my heart like a tornado

00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:05.832
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
you have shown me your tricks

00:26:05.966 --> 00:26:10.437
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

00:26:10.571 --> 00:26:12.906
You shook me up

00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:13.640
BABY BAKERY

00:26:16.443 --> 00:26:18.946
I like you, lady

00:26:23.984 --> 00:26:29.790
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
You have shown me your tricks

00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:35.896
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.132
-We cannot give loans for airplanes.
-Sir, please listen to me.

00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:41.535
You know we are a tiny rural bank.

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:44.338
Morning, ma'am.
Can I meet Mr. Mittal, Venture Capitalist?

00:26:44.471 --> 00:26:46.607
- I am Chandra--
-I have many of these already, sir.

00:26:50.744 --> 00:26:52.813
-I'll send it to the aviation minister.
-Thank you, sir.

00:26:59.953 --> 00:27:04.725
A simple thing to say
spoken brash and blunt

00:27:05.826 --> 00:27:10.697
I am amused to see myself in you
whenever you come in my sight

00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:17.704
I wonder if I will ever lay my eyes
on a girl like you

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:22.809
Even if I am delayed by millennia
I will still seek you out

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.712
O my dimple-cheeked bird

00:27:25.846 --> 00:27:28.248
I have wed you

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.987
And now, I am born again

00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:41.695
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
You have shown me your tricks

00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:47.701
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:50.404
I can't meet anyone right now.
I'm late for my flight.

00:27:51.538 --> 00:27:52.339
Sir.

00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:57.411
-Mam, one meeting--
-Please give your card over there.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.914
You always make these fritters.

00:28:01.515 --> 00:28:02.983
Why can't you make cakes?

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.053
Look at the mugs wanting cakes!

00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:07.788
Baby's Cakes!

00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:12.159
Sweets from Tenali
for the spicy tongues of Guntur!

00:28:12.226 --> 00:28:13.694
-Mr. Paresh Goswami...
-Look!

00:28:13.794 --> 00:28:15.629
I already have a hundred of your cards!

00:28:15.796 --> 00:28:17.898
You can't meet him.
Why don't you understand?

00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:40.187
Are you a fortune teller
or a programmer?

00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:42.489
-The logic's wrong. Override it.
-One second.

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.258
It's running, sir!

00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:46.260
Source code ready!
Brilliant, sir!

00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:47.494
It is running, sir!
Superb, sir!

00:28:47.628 --> 00:28:49.162
Oh, really?

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:51.632
How many millions
are you going to make from this?

00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:53.800
Corrupting IIT kids
with his lofty ideas!

00:28:53.934 --> 00:28:56.436
You should become a professor at IIT, sir.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.472
-Yes, sir. You should become a professor.
-Yes, sir.

00:28:58.539 --> 00:28:59.573
Yes, sir!
You should!

00:28:59.673 --> 00:29:02.376
If I was that smart,
I would have moved out of his place.

00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:08.015
Both of you quit the Air Force
yapping about some big dreams.

00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:09.349
What did you achieve...

00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:10.684
Son-in-law!
Sebastian!

00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:12.686
You need an ex-serviceman loan, right?

00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:14.821
-Your friend's reputation precedes him.
-Bring my bag.

00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:18.458
Especially now with Naidu sitting
in Tambaram!

00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:20.594
-He's not going to sign.
-I can't hear you!

00:29:20.694 --> 00:29:23.697
You eat my food
and pretend to not hear me.

00:29:23.797 --> 00:29:25.032
-I can't hear you.
-Of course, you don't.

00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:25.899
Thank you.

00:29:26.934 --> 00:29:29.803
This loan won't be approved
without Naidu's recommendation letter.

00:29:29.937 --> 00:29:31.505
So, I want you to shut up, okay?

00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:34.641
Che went through a lot
trouble to get this appointment.

00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:37.344
-So, you shut up! Understand?
-Hmm.

00:29:37.477 --> 00:29:39.346
What "Hmm"?
Are you listening to me.

00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:41.682
-I'm not deaf!
-Good boy! Go, go.

00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:48.555
Chandra Mahesh,
let me spell it out for you.

00:29:49.656 --> 00:29:53.327
Even though I can,
I won't sign this recommendation letter.

00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:59.466
You want my best pilot Chaitanya to resign
and ruin his life.

00:29:59.566 --> 00:30:01.502
I don't like people who break rules.

00:30:01.635 --> 00:30:03.770
-You're not fit to be a leader!
-Let's go.

00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:06.673
Sir.

00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:12.713
Hey, Seby and Maha.
What happened?

00:30:12.846 --> 00:30:15.148
The same crap even after all these years.

00:30:15.249 --> 00:30:17.317
-Egoistic jackasses, both!
-Maha, stop.

00:30:17.417 --> 00:30:20.821
Forget him and the banks.
Let's figure out our next move.

00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:21.788
I just did.

00:30:22.055 --> 00:30:23.056
Hold on, Maha.

00:30:25.893 --> 00:30:27.594
-Twenty thousand rupees, yes?
-Yes.

00:30:28.395 --> 00:30:29.396
-Have a nice journey.
-Thank you.

00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:31.565
These people have nothing better to do.

00:30:31.698 --> 00:30:35.102
Sir, I've just two boxes
of fryum and pickles.

00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:37.237
-They'll be ruined if I check them in!
-That is not my problem, ma'am.

00:30:37.371 --> 00:30:39.239
-You're delaying the passengers.
-My sister's pregnant.

00:30:39.306 --> 00:30:40.207
Please come forward, sir.

00:30:40.274 --> 00:30:41.875
-Do you know about pregnancy cravings?
-You have to check it in.

00:30:41.942 --> 00:30:42.976
You are a man.
How can you know about it?

00:30:43.043 --> 00:30:44.111
Ma'am, I can't help you.

00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:45.579
Have you ever been pregnant?

00:30:45.712 --> 00:30:47.214
Please send the manager
to counter number four.

00:30:47.281 --> 00:30:48.348
Good. Call the manager!

00:30:48.448 --> 00:30:51.118
-Is she a lady, she'll understand.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:52.719
I'll take them. No problem.

00:30:52.853 --> 00:30:55.522
-I can take them.
-Thank you very much, sir.

00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:57.891
Look, he is with me.
Check me in now!

00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:59.393
-Check me in, I say!
-Sure, ma'am.

00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:00.160
Yes, give it to me.

00:31:00.227 --> 00:31:02.229
You won't run off with these, will you?

00:31:02.362 --> 00:31:03.830
Fryums and pickles.

00:31:04.097 --> 00:31:05.098
Are you a reporter?

00:31:05.232 --> 00:31:06.533
Yes, how did you know?

00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:08.402
You ask too many questions.

00:31:08.535 --> 00:31:11.205
Yeah!
Actually, this flight is full of media.

00:31:12.072 --> 00:31:16.443
Paresh Goswami himself is flying us
to the RRTV Awards.

00:31:16.577 --> 00:31:18.412
-Is that where you are going?
-Yes.

00:31:18.545 --> 00:31:20.881
I've not seen you
in media before.

00:31:21.315 --> 00:31:24.318
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
Senior Producer, All India Radio.

00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:25.285
Okay.

00:31:25.452 --> 00:31:26.553
Where are you going?

00:31:28.956 --> 00:31:31.558
Am I bothering you
with my questions?

00:31:31.658 --> 00:31:32.926
I still want an answer.
Please tell me.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.261
-Where are you going?
-Thanks.

00:31:34.795 --> 00:31:36.964
-To meet someone.
-Whom?

00:31:44.905 --> 00:31:45.806
Good afternoon, sir.

00:31:51.378 --> 00:31:52.946
-Excuse me.
-Sir?

00:31:53.747 --> 00:31:56.016
My brother Bhawarlal's outside.

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:57.985
-Please send him in.
-Sure, sir! Sure, sir!

00:32:06.493 --> 00:32:08.762
-Shall I cancel the flight?
-No, no.

00:32:09.196 --> 00:32:11.398
It's just an anxiety attack.
It's okay.

00:32:11.498 --> 00:32:12.332
Change your shirt.

00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:15.202
Take your pill.

00:32:17.237 --> 00:32:17.905
Bhawar.

00:32:19.706 --> 00:32:24.945
Do the staff use the same restrooms
as the guests?

00:32:27.814 --> 00:32:30.184
A steward just used one.

00:32:30.317 --> 00:32:31.318
I'll have it cleaned.

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:34.421
Shivdas Airport Services.

00:32:34.888 --> 00:32:36.456
I'll have him fired.

00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:38.625
The Paresh Goswami?

00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:40.961
Why do you want to meet such a big shot?

00:32:41.028 --> 00:32:42.896
To discuss a business partnership.

00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:45.332
There's no way you can meet him.

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:46.834
I'll make him my business partner.

00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:48.569
Are you kidding?

00:32:48.702 --> 00:32:51.071
He won't even talk to you.
Want to bet?

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:55.342
-What if he did?
-Out of the question.

00:32:55.475 --> 00:32:57.911
At most, we can just applaud his speech.

00:33:00.547 --> 00:33:04.484
Why are you getting up?
That call's for business class.

00:33:04.585 --> 00:33:07.387
You didn't say what you'll do
if you lose.

00:33:07.654 --> 00:33:09.756
I'll tell you what to do
when I win.

00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:11.158
Business class?

00:33:11.258 --> 00:33:12.726
You must be really rich.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.563
Then why wait in the queue?
You're strange!

00:33:16.697 --> 00:33:18.765
You spent 40,000
to fly in business class?

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.868
Didn't you say
I can't meet him at the event?

00:33:21.001 --> 00:33:22.202
Hence, business class.

00:33:22.703 --> 00:33:25.172
You don't need 40,000,
twenty's enough.

00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:27.274
I'll be returning by train.

00:33:27.407 --> 00:33:30.544
I'm not rich, I emptied
my bank account to buy the ticket.

00:33:31.378 --> 00:33:33.180
Sir, anyways, please take care

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.415
of my fryums and pickles.

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:36.984
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

00:33:45.893 --> 00:33:47.494
Good evening, sir.
Welcome on board.

00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:50.030
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
Captain Sharma from the flight deck.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.665
On behalf of first officer Matthew

00:33:51.765 --> 00:33:53.467
and the crew,
we welcome you all

00:33:53.634 --> 00:33:56.803
onboard Jaz Airlines, JZ 433
Chennai to Mumbai.

00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:58.338
We have with us today,
our chairman, Mr. Goswami...

00:33:58.472 --> 00:34:01.074
- Mr. Paresh, hello.-Our heartiest welcome to you, sir.

00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:04.444
Right, sir.
I'll see you in Bombay.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.651
Congratulations on the award, sir.
Proud moment for the Jaz family.

00:34:20.627 --> 00:34:23.463
Hello, sir.
I'm Chandra Mahesh.

00:34:23.597 --> 00:34:25.599
You're the inspiration
for my airline.

00:34:25.732 --> 00:34:28.435
May I request you
to return to your seat, sir?

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.671
-Right, sir.
-It's fine.

00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:31.538
Pleasure, sir.

00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:36.977
You intend to start an airline?

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:42.749
Yes, sir.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.353
An airline for the common man.
To travel at low-cost.

00:34:46.486 --> 00:34:48.055
-Chandrababu?
-It's Chandra Mahesh.

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:52.626
Would these people you speak of
want three square meals a day

00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:54.995
or fly in a plane?

00:34:55.128 --> 00:34:57.297
Sir, I won't confuse them
with the choices.

00:34:57.431 --> 00:34:59.199
With my ticket fare,
they can do both.

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:02.336
Are you planning
some kind of social service?

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:04.838
I want to execute this idea
with you, sir.

00:35:06.707 --> 00:35:11.378
Everyone in here has an idea
to become a billionaire.

00:35:11.512 --> 00:35:14.515
They all sound great.

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:16.984
But practically impossible.

00:35:17.117 --> 00:35:19.686
I never waste time
talking about the impossible.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.355
My idea's practically possible.

00:35:22.322 --> 00:35:26.460
So you want to sell tickets
at a cheap price and still be profitable.

00:35:27.628 --> 00:35:31.198
You're saying this didn't occur to us?

00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:33.901
Yes, sir.

00:35:35.169 --> 00:35:38.539
Today, no Indian can book air tickets
without a travel agency.

00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:40.140
We all know that.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.910
A big chunk of the fare goes
to the travel agent.

00:35:43.043 --> 00:35:45.579
Like it goes to the middlemen
in farming.

00:35:45.712 --> 00:35:47.147
What if we bypass that?

00:35:47.748 --> 00:35:49.583
Bypass a travel agency?

00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:53.554
Then how will customers book tickets?

00:35:53.687 --> 00:35:54.421
The internet!

00:35:55.422 --> 00:35:57.558
They book tickets
through computers.

00:35:57.791 --> 00:35:58.592
Wow!

00:35:59.126 --> 00:36:02.829
So a farmer who's never seen a computer
nor the internet

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:07.201
will book tickets thus and fly.

00:36:07.334 --> 00:36:08.335
Fantastic!

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.606
Internet's available in 500 post offices
in AP alone.

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:16.410
And 1,453 Reliance petrol bunks
all over India has an internet facility.

00:36:16.543 --> 00:36:17.544
They can book there!

00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:20.747
Then the farmers won't need computers,
right?

00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:25.285
But this requires
specialized booking software.

00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:27.454
I don't think you're aware of it.

00:36:27.588 --> 00:36:29.456
You must be aware of Interworld.

00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:32.993
They make ticketing software
for all major airlines.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.128
They've agreed to do it for me.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.167
You can make
a tailor fly alongside a textile baron.

00:36:46.573 --> 00:36:48.642
-Yes, I can make that happen.
-Sir.

00:36:50.544 --> 00:36:52.112
But I won't.

00:36:54.281 --> 00:36:55.048
Why, sir?

00:36:55.516 --> 00:37:00.921
Would anyone want to see
beggars and coolies on planes?

00:37:01.922 --> 00:37:03.724
I don't want my passengers to suffer.

00:37:04.224 --> 00:37:06.593
Is that why
your airfare is so expensive?

00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:09.096
I have an airline to run, my friend.

00:37:09.229 --> 00:37:10.864
-What you're doing is...
-Get him out.

00:37:11.331 --> 00:37:12.366
Put him in economy.

00:37:15.736 --> 00:37:18.472
Why the fuck should I go?
I've bought the ticket.

00:37:18.605 --> 00:37:20.941
Lay a hand on me,
I'll rip your throat out.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:27.648
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:37:27.714 --> 00:37:29.516
this is Captain Sharma again,
from the flight deck.

00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:32.419
Unfortunately, the aircraft is developed
a technical snag.

00:37:32.486 --> 00:37:34.121
We need to turn around to Chennai.

00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:40.827
You own the ticket.

00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:43.397
I own the plane, my friend.

00:37:54.107 --> 00:37:55.242
-This way. sir.
-This way.

00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:57.744
I know the drill.
My job here's done.

00:37:57.878 --> 00:37:58.579
Ma'am.

00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:01.181
Your fryums and pickles.

00:38:01.782 --> 00:38:03.016
-Thank you.
-See you.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.819
-Chandra Mahesh, careful.
-Yeah? Thanks.

00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:06.587
Bye.

00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:14.161
Mr. Chandra Mahesh,
I was on that flight, too.

00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:16.463
I heard what you told Paresh.

00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:20.434
I'm Prakash Babu.
SCI Venture Capitalists.

00:38:20.501 --> 00:38:22.402
I know.
I've been to your office many times.

00:38:22.503 --> 00:38:25.138
Alright.
I'll give you the time now.

00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:25.973
Okay?

00:38:26.373 --> 00:38:28.542
Five minutes.
Come along.

00:38:32.012 --> 00:38:34.248
-Take care of table two.
-Okay, sir.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.585
Mahesh, if you're hungry,

00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:40.320
we could've gone
to the five-star hotel nearby.

00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:42.956
There's no better place
to explain my idea to you, sir.

00:38:43.023 --> 00:38:44.358
-Brother, how are you?
-Fine, brother.

00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:46.159
-What can I get you? Okay.
-Dosa, please.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.562
What's the connection
between Udupi hotel and airline?

00:38:49.563 --> 00:38:52.266
Today, an air ticket to Delhi
costs Rs. 12,000.

00:38:52.399 --> 00:38:54.334
First class costs 20,000.

00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:55.335
Definitely.

00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:57.571
Running airline is an expensive affair.

00:38:57.704 --> 00:39:02.242
Flight maintenance, hangar charges,
pilot salary, fuel costs...

00:39:02.376 --> 00:39:03.777
It's a costly business!

00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:04.611
Dig in.

00:39:05.279 --> 00:39:06.180
Please have it.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.550
They did not get Poori. Please check.

00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:19.793
How is it, sir?

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.862
Actually, it's tasty.

00:39:22.196 --> 00:39:23.864
-Very good.
-Thank you, sir!

00:39:23.931 --> 00:39:24.698
It's delicious.

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:26.433
Brother!

00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:30.304
-Where do you get your provisions?
-Chintamani stores at More market!

00:39:30.838 --> 00:39:32.172
Who is their biggest customer?

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:34.875
The five-star hotel
in the neighboring street.

00:39:35.742 --> 00:39:37.778
You know what's funny?

00:39:37.911 --> 00:39:40.647
We provide dinner for their staff too!

00:39:41.215 --> 00:39:41.882
You continue, please.

00:39:44.451 --> 00:39:46.653
Have you had dosa
at the five-star hotel nearby?

00:39:47.788 --> 00:39:50.457
When I get good dosa here
for 16 bucks,

00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:52.659
why will I waste 200 bucks there?

00:39:52.793 --> 00:39:53.827
Sure, brother.

00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:57.764
-The dosa's great here. Enjoy!
-Okay, brother.

00:39:57.898 --> 00:39:59.099
Do you get it, sir?

00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:00.801
Everyone's happy.

00:40:00.934 --> 00:40:04.838
The same dish is sold under a fancy name
at the five-star hotel.

00:40:04.972 --> 00:40:07.074
Only difference is, this is cheaper.

00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:09.476
But no difference
in taste and hygiene.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:10.944
No needless expenses.

00:40:11.078 --> 00:40:13.280
My airline will operate in the same way.

00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:16.183
Why have food and newspapers
on an hour-long flight?

00:40:16.316 --> 00:40:18.519
I will neither provide them
nor charge for them.

00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:20.287
Ten percent of costs drop right away.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.156
We keep our flights very light.
No extra food no staff.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.826
Other airlines do two trips a day.
We will do six.

00:40:25.959 --> 00:40:26.960
Six trips?

00:40:27.094 --> 00:40:27.761
How?

00:40:28.462 --> 00:40:29.897
There is Flight Duty Time Limitation.

00:40:30.597 --> 00:40:34.334
Staff cannot fly
for more than eight hours.

00:40:34.468 --> 00:40:35.802
Let's plan three shifts.

00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:38.305
Three shifts.
Eighteen hours of flying time.

00:40:38.438 --> 00:40:41.775
Deduct C&D checks, cleaning, and fueling,
we still fly 14 hours.

00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:44.211
Only humans tire.
Planes don't, right?

00:40:44.344 --> 00:40:46.880
But, this isn't the norm.

00:40:46.947 --> 00:40:47.881
It's not the convention.

00:40:48.115 --> 00:40:50.751
Let's change it.
Let's break every damn rule.

00:40:51.985 --> 00:40:52.819
Look, sir.

00:40:53.353 --> 00:40:55.389
No table's empty,
no waiter's idle.

00:40:55.722 --> 00:40:59.193
Simply put,
our airline's the Udupi Hotel in the sky.

00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:03.530
You didn't tell me you were starting
an Udupi Hotel!

00:41:03.664 --> 00:41:05.632
-Not on this street.
-Then, it's fine!

00:41:05.732 --> 00:41:07.167
-If I...
-Say no?

00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:09.803
I've tried 23 VCs and 56 banks
so far.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:14.141
And all they said was,
"Who is this crazy fool?"

00:41:14.241 --> 00:41:17.744
If you say the same,
I'll just go find VC number 24.

00:41:17.978 --> 00:41:18.645
I'm done.

00:41:24.718 --> 00:41:25.652
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

00:41:34.661 --> 00:41:35.662
-Mahesh.
-Sir!

00:41:35.863 --> 00:41:39.600
Come to my office next month.
8th of April.

00:41:39.733 --> 00:41:41.969
Convince the rest of the board.

00:41:42.302 --> 00:41:44.605
-Okay? Bye.
-Yeah.

00:41:47.107 --> 00:41:48.609
There's a girl named Nagalakshmi.

00:41:48.742 --> 00:41:51.845
My mom's blackmailing me
into meeting her.

00:41:51.945 --> 00:41:54.948
Let me go over there
and set that right!

00:41:59.753 --> 00:42:04.391
The kids have gone nuts after you
showed them that film on planes.

00:42:04.458 --> 00:42:09.296
We were doomed to carts, Subba.
At least, let the kids fly!

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:13.934
My bike can't go any faster!

00:42:15.035 --> 00:42:16.170
Maha, wait!

00:42:34.321 --> 00:42:34.988
WELCOME TO
GUNTUR MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION

00:42:35.055 --> 00:42:37.591
Unfortunately, I borrowed
from that damn loan shark Ravi!

00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:39.660
He comes here every day without fail

00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:41.328
and hounds me for money!

00:42:41.395 --> 00:42:42.129
Hey, you bloody...

00:42:42.229 --> 00:42:43.497
Isn't this that girl's shop?

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.766
Your mom told us to meet Nagalakshmi.
Let's go!

00:42:45.899 --> 00:42:47.968
-Let's buy sweets!
-Hello, son-in-law!

00:42:48.101 --> 00:42:49.603
What brings you here?

00:42:49.736 --> 00:42:51.405
Get down.

00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:54.341
You rejected us
and now call him son-in-law?

00:42:54.474 --> 00:42:56.310
Load up two kilos of cakes!

00:42:56.443 --> 00:43:00.581
Is this a scrap shop? It's a bakery!
It's "pack two kilos of cakes."

00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:02.115
Whatever!

00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:03.817
Give me samples of these two.

00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:07.287
Eating for free is called 'sampling', eh?
Nasty habit!

00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:11.658
How dare you come here
after calling me a bun?

00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:14.194
Let's go, buddy.
It's a bullshit bakery!

00:43:14.728 --> 00:43:15.395
Are you married?

00:43:15.963 --> 00:43:17.631
Yes. Two kids. You?

00:43:17.698 --> 00:43:19.466
-What about you?
-We're meeting a prospective bride.

00:43:19.533 --> 00:43:20.734
That's why we stopped here
for sweets.

00:43:21.101 --> 00:43:23.370
So you've been at it for three years?

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.706
Where's the airplane company?

00:43:26.006 --> 00:43:28.642
You know VC?
The venture capitalist?

00:43:29.209 --> 00:43:30.043
They've okayed my project.

00:43:30.344 --> 00:43:33.180
Few formalities left on DGCA licenses,
and NOC.

00:43:33.313 --> 00:43:35.516
So you're still on the step one?

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:37.584
I'm already on the step three!

00:43:38.318 --> 00:43:38.986
Hello?

00:43:39.686 --> 00:43:41.221
I'm going to launch in a month!

00:43:41.455 --> 00:43:43.490
-I see...
-Ah, now you're gobsmacked?

00:43:43.624 --> 00:43:45.125
You wish!

00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:49.129
Had you bought an auto or bus,
you would've made some money!

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:50.998
What does your husband
do for a living?

00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:54.535
We're set to open another branch,
mind you!

00:43:54.868 --> 00:43:56.370
What does the little one want?

00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:58.539
-Freshly made cakes!
-Why are you crying?

00:43:58.672 --> 00:44:01.475
-Fifty rupees discount for you!
-Do you want a cake?

00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:02.876
Okay, don't cry!

00:44:03.043 --> 00:44:05.846
Why is he so pissed?

00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:06.980
-Shall we go?
-Let's eat a cake.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.650
Do you call this cake?
It's disgusting.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.752
Sugary crap!
Spit it out!

00:44:11.885 --> 00:44:13.320
It's pretty good, buddy!

00:44:13.487 --> 00:44:14.154
Hey.

00:44:15.255 --> 00:44:16.723
No human can eat these.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.193
Damn country bumpkins!
Country brute.

00:44:19.326 --> 00:44:21.929
Would any sane person open a bakery
near a liquor shop?

00:44:22.362 --> 00:44:24.164
Should've been near a school
or college.

00:44:25.065 --> 00:44:26.733
You need brains to work that out!

00:44:29.203 --> 00:44:31.338
Buddy!
Maha!

00:44:32.105 --> 00:44:33.240
I found out something.

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:35.275
Nothing happened.

00:44:35.909 --> 00:44:37.511
What are you talking about?

00:44:37.611 --> 00:44:40.247
That bun girl isn't married yet!

00:44:40.948 --> 00:44:44.251
Her loudmouth uncle told me!

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:47.754
Can I eat her cakes now?

00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:51.892
Sweets from Tenali
for the spicy tongues of Guntur!

00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:54.962
Milk cakes! Cheesecakes!
Butter cakes!

00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:58.298
Buy one, get one free!

00:44:58.432 --> 00:45:00.167
Baby's cakes!
Yummy cakes!

00:45:00.234 --> 00:45:02.035
-Those were your friend's kids, right?
-Amazing taste.

00:45:02.102 --> 00:45:03.136
Why did you bluff?

00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:04.638
Paneer cake!
Made by Baby Bakery!

00:45:04.705 --> 00:45:06.974
-Why did you lie to me?
-Milk cake, butter cake,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.242
-Hey, bun face!
-Baby...

00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:12.446
Listen to me!
The world calls us crackpots.

00:45:12.579 --> 00:45:14.014
No one would come forward
to marry us.

00:45:14.615 --> 00:45:15.983
So why don't we get married?

00:45:16.049 --> 00:45:16.917
What do you say?

00:45:17.084 --> 00:45:18.085
Oh, really?

00:45:18.218 --> 00:45:21.555
So why didn't you see this crackpot
in three years?

00:45:21.655 --> 00:45:23.957
Back then,
I couldn't even feed myself.

00:45:24.324 --> 00:45:27.160
Those barren lands are green now!
Good income!

00:45:27.294 --> 00:45:30.397
My business kicks off in a month!
Good enough, right?

00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:35.502
Amazing taste! Super taste!
Baby's Bakery!

00:45:36.236 --> 00:45:37.237
And if it fails?

00:45:37.337 --> 00:45:39.640
Who says it's only a husband
who provides for the wife?

00:45:39.773 --> 00:45:41.108
Won't you feed me?

00:45:44.645 --> 00:45:45.679
What do you say, bun face?

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.948
I got three conditions.

00:45:48.482 --> 00:45:49.183
What are they?

00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:52.152
It's a bait, kiddo.
Don't fall for it!

00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:56.089
One, it's our money,
not your money or my money.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.191
Got it.

00:45:57.324 --> 00:46:01.929
Two, my business
is as important as yours. Got it?

00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:03.564
Sure.

00:46:03.664 --> 00:46:06.099
This is 2.1, your brain can't process
more than two points.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.135
-Hey.
-Our family's very important to me.

00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:11.805
And if you let us down,
I'll poison your food!

00:46:12.372 --> 00:46:14.942
If you agree to these conditions,
we can marry tomorrow.

00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:16.977
I already said yes to all of it!

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.179
You better think hard

00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:20.547
because I won't divorce you.

00:46:20.681 --> 00:46:21.782
I won't ask for it either.

00:46:21.882 --> 00:46:23.550
Okay. How come you agreed now?

00:46:23.617 --> 00:46:25.385
Sometimes,
no matter how hard we think,

00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:27.788
we end up doing what we want.

00:46:27.888 --> 00:46:29.122
Why waste time?

00:46:30.624 --> 00:46:32.059
Come on over!

00:46:32.192 --> 00:46:33.961
Buy one loony,
get another free!

00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:35.963
Buy two loonies,
get both free!

00:46:36.063 --> 00:46:38.532
Both loonies are available!
Come get them!

00:46:52.579 --> 00:46:58.385
Kohl-eyes light up looking at you
Oh boy

00:46:58.519 --> 00:47:04.391
Words fail me
As if I am chewing on the water

00:47:04.558 --> 00:47:10.564
Like a home adorned with colorful
Designs my heart is resounding with joy

00:47:10.697 --> 00:47:16.336
Like gathered neem leaves
A procession is arriving my way

00:47:16.436 --> 00:47:22.442
You caress me like the coins
In the folds of my saree

00:47:22.943 --> 00:47:28.882
You are the noise
That keeps me up all night

00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:33.787
My desires, once like a dried-up forest
Suddenly blossom

00:47:35.055 --> 00:47:39.259
My heart revolves around you
And asks to give me yours

00:47:39.326 --> 00:47:41.929
I, Sundari aka Baby,
Who lives in Tenali...

00:47:46.567 --> 00:47:50.437
To all of you who came to this wedding

00:47:50.571 --> 00:47:53.807
jam cakes will be provided.
With cameraman Rani, this is Mangaraju.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.531
Ward off the evil eye!

00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:19.066
Just thirty bucks?

00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:20.667
-You deserve less.
-Oh, really?

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:29.643
Like the pigeon perched atop a tower
I look for you in directions many

00:48:29.776 --> 00:48:35.349
Whenever I hear a little flutter
My heart hops like a hare

00:48:35.482 --> 00:48:38.685
Should I open my heart and spill
Or shed my shame and tell?

00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:41.455
I desire no one but you

00:48:41.588 --> 00:48:47.261
You pinch my cheek
And tame the wild fire I hold tight

00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:53.267
Sting me like a wasp

00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:58.972
Coil around me like a python

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.676
Baby, for your new bakery.

00:49:07.848 --> 00:49:08.982
-Baby?
-Yes, bro?

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:11.618
-Can I hang it here?
-Put it over there!

00:49:12.219 --> 00:49:14.655
When you see it,
you'll be stunned, madam.

00:49:14.788 --> 00:49:17.891
With the college nearby,
the business will soar.

00:49:18.025 --> 00:49:19.960
Imagine my cakes being sold here.

00:49:24.031 --> 00:49:25.666
Do you know what this is?
A pager.

00:49:25.799 --> 00:49:27.067
We can talk easily
if it is a phone, right?

00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:28.702
-What to do with it?
-It's for you.

00:49:30.571 --> 00:49:32.673
This thing looks a little off!

00:49:32.806 --> 00:49:33.841
You try drawing it!

00:49:35.676 --> 00:49:38.378
As the plane's weight increases,
so will fuel cost.

00:49:38.512 --> 00:49:39.880
An airline in America...

00:49:40.013 --> 00:49:40.981
Pay attention!

00:49:41.481 --> 00:49:44.852
They cut down 500 pounds
by not painting their flights!

00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:46.687
That's four people flying for free!

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.555
So you don't like weight?

00:50:03.837 --> 00:50:06.874
Without a sword
You nipped my beauty

00:50:07.007 --> 00:50:09.843
Without the touch of your fingernail
You pinched my waist!

00:50:09.943 --> 00:50:12.946
Oh my
You behave like you are unaware

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.516
You ignite and slide away
So cleverly

00:50:15.616 --> 00:50:17.384
When I am next to you

00:50:17.518 --> 00:50:21.555
Like a pot of spicy fish curry
My youth simmers

00:50:21.688 --> 00:50:25.025
Like a hot plate of delicacy
I'll caress your taste buds

00:50:25.125 --> 00:50:27.394
Do savor it all day

00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:31.131
Crack the knuckles of my fingers slowly

00:50:31.265 --> 00:50:33.934
Smoothen out the folds of my saree

00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:37.104
The craze for you has trapped me
And it refuses to leave

00:50:37.237 --> 00:50:41.975
I'll string you onto me
Like a chain of black beads

00:50:43.443 --> 00:50:48.148
I'll attach you to me
Like backbone

00:50:55.455 --> 00:51:00.460
To sum it up, passengers must be able to
buy plane tickets, like they do soaps.

00:51:00.594 --> 00:51:02.729
Together, we can make this happen.
That's it.

00:51:03.197 --> 00:51:03.897
Thank you.

00:51:04.064 --> 00:51:06.733
Indian Airlines
has a thousand crore debt.

00:51:06.834 --> 00:51:09.803
And you want to make profits
with thousand rupee tickets to Delhi?

00:51:09.937 --> 00:51:12.406
My competitor is the Indian Railways,
not Indian Airlines.

00:51:12.472 --> 00:51:15.042
-Indian Railways?
-And they are doing very well.

00:51:15.576 --> 00:51:19.079
A Boeing plane costs 136 crores,
Mr. Mahesh.

00:51:19.179 --> 00:51:21.415
Even a second-hand one
costs 90 crores.

00:51:21.515 --> 00:51:23.617
What can you do with just ten crores?

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.252
I didn't say I was buying planes.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.921
We'll lease them.

00:51:28.322 --> 00:51:30.791
What if your revenue is less
than expected?

00:51:30.924 --> 00:51:35.262
At 70% occupancy, like most airlines,
we can earn 12.42 crores.

00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:37.331
That's a profit of 4.14 crores.

00:51:37.464 --> 00:51:38.465
Sounds impossible.

00:51:38.866 --> 00:51:40.300
-Deeksha?
-He's right.

00:51:40.501 --> 00:51:41.735
Oh! Let me see that!

00:51:42.169 --> 00:51:44.338
If it's less than 70% occupancy?

00:51:44.471 --> 00:51:47.241
If it's 70% at ten thousand rupees
per ticket,

00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:51.111
won't I get at least 50% occupancy
with thousand rupee tickets?

00:51:51.545 --> 00:51:53.714
You are talking way below market rates.

00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:57.618
Who will lease Boeings to you
at such low rates?

00:51:58.151 --> 00:51:59.353
-PlaneAm.
-Really?

00:52:01.855 --> 00:52:05.125
The Twin Tower attack
affected their airline business.

00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:07.861
They're willing to give us planes
at half the price.

00:52:15.068 --> 00:52:16.370
Congratulations, Mahesh.

00:52:16.503 --> 00:52:17.738
They've sanctioned funds.

00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:21.575
If we get the DGCA license
then we can launch our airline.

00:52:22.743 --> 00:52:24.178
Well done, Maha.

00:52:24.311 --> 00:52:25.379
All thanks to you, sir.

00:52:25.512 --> 00:52:26.980
-No, no. It's okay.
-If you weren't here...

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.715
-Just one thing.
-Sir.

00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:31.952
Can you get an advance ready
and reserve the planes right away?

00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:32.753
Advance?

00:52:32.819 --> 00:52:34.421
-You want me to pay the advance?
-Yes.

00:52:34.555 --> 00:52:36.890
-How much would you need, Mahesh?
-47 lakhs.

00:52:37.024 --> 00:52:40.194
It will take at least four to five months
to release funds.

00:52:40.327 --> 00:52:42.429
If PlaneAm hikes their rates
in the meantime,

00:52:42.563 --> 00:52:45.365
or if someone else steals this idea,
we'll be in trouble.

00:52:45.499 --> 00:52:47.601
Our entire business hinges on this.

00:52:47.734 --> 00:52:49.837
Unlicensed planes can't fly into India.

00:52:49.937 --> 00:52:53.507
Get them to Malaysia
and start painting and stickering there.

00:52:53.874 --> 00:52:56.410
We'll get them to India
once we get the license.

00:52:56.543 --> 00:52:58.412
I like this idea, sir.
I'll handle this.

00:53:15.028 --> 00:53:17.364
Folks come by to get loans
for tractors and autos.

00:53:17.464 --> 00:53:20.567
You're the first to ask for airplanes!

00:53:20.701 --> 00:53:21.368
Alright then.

00:53:21.502 --> 00:53:25.272
What a proud moment
if one of ours starts an airline!

00:53:25.706 --> 00:53:27.908
I had a lot of dreams in my youth.

00:53:28.041 --> 00:53:29.643
But no one gave me money then.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:31.311
Projected profit
for the first six months...

00:53:31.378 --> 00:53:34.781
That's okay.
I'm allergic to computers.

00:53:35.249 --> 00:53:38.919
-How much, ma'am? 47 lakhs?
-Yes. 47 lakhs.

00:53:39.386 --> 00:53:41.722
Check if this loan's feasible.

00:53:41.889 --> 00:53:45.092
Don't mistake me.
Just standard procedure.

00:53:45.158 --> 00:53:47.127
Depending on current rates,
its value is 40 lakhs.

00:53:47.294 --> 00:53:49.296
They want an excess of seven lakhs!

00:53:49.363 --> 00:53:51.098
We can't give money
without these documents.

00:53:51.164 --> 00:53:53.166
He's my teacher's son!

00:53:53.433 --> 00:53:54.768
-Give him the money.
-Alright.

00:53:58.105 --> 00:54:00.274
Sign these documents, ma'am.

00:54:01.275 --> 00:54:03.810
You're starting a business.

00:54:03.944 --> 00:54:05.779
It is good to face east and sign.

00:54:06.914 --> 00:54:11.618
If you default payment by even a day
the next three months,

00:54:11.685 --> 00:54:13.654
-you'll have to pay two-fold interest.
-I'll pay on time.

00:54:13.787 --> 00:54:14.788
Brother, that's okay.

00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:18.959
Ma'am, please go.
I'll send the money over.

00:54:19.092 --> 00:54:21.461
-What's next?
-Get a license from the DGCA.

00:54:21.595 --> 00:54:23.597
-What's that?
-Like the RTO office in town?

00:54:23.697 --> 00:54:26.166
We need a license from them to fly.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.168
Replay the reel from the beginning!

00:54:31.405 --> 00:54:33.240
Okay, sir.
I will take care of this.

00:54:36.343 --> 00:54:37.978
Why did you give him an appointment?

00:54:38.812 --> 00:54:41.448
He was referred by Prakash Babu
from SCI.

00:54:41.548 --> 00:54:43.150
He's been waiting for two months.

00:54:43.283 --> 00:54:45.819
He should know
meeting DGCA isn't easy.

00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:47.221
-Let him wait.
-Yes, sir.

00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:54.795
Sir, you asked me to come to 8:30 am,
but I was here at 7 am.

00:54:54.895 --> 00:54:57.798
I was here before the peon.
Yet, you haven't called me.

00:54:57.898 --> 00:54:59.800
-Please wait!
-Sir...

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.336
-Sir, first appointment was given to me.
-Excuse me.

00:55:03.637 --> 00:55:06.874
Get going, all of you.
Sir will be back in an hour.

00:55:14.081 --> 00:55:15.082
Car's ready, sir.

00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:18.552
I'm Mahesh.
Mr. Prakash Babu reference.

00:55:18.685 --> 00:55:21.255
-I'm sorry. You're still here?
-It's alright.

00:55:21.388 --> 00:55:23.524
I have an urgent meeting
with the new aviation minister.

00:55:24.057 --> 00:55:25.759
-Can we meet tomorrow?
-Sure, sir.

00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:27.294
-Nice.
-Thank you.

00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:28.028
Bye.

00:55:32.699 --> 00:55:35.035
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.115
Oh, Mahesh.

00:55:48.448 --> 00:55:50.517
-I went through your documents.
-Oh, thanks.

00:55:50.584 --> 00:55:52.052
-Very interesting.
-Sir.

00:55:52.186 --> 00:55:53.787
We can wrap it up tomorrow, right?

00:55:53.887 --> 00:55:55.022
-Yes.
-No problem, right?

00:55:55.422 --> 00:55:57.624
-Okay, sir. I'll wait.
-Nice.

00:55:58.458 --> 00:56:00.561
Did you set up a meeting
with the aviation minister?

00:56:00.694 --> 00:56:01.762
I spoke to his PA.

00:56:01.895 --> 00:56:03.263
-When is it?
-Tomorrow.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.167
Mahesh?

00:56:08.769 --> 00:56:09.436
Sir?

00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:12.072
We wrap it up today, right?

00:56:12.206 --> 00:56:14.408
He's off for a week.
Didn't you know?

00:56:14.808 --> 00:56:15.776
Come back later.

00:56:19.746 --> 00:56:20.781
You're his assistant, right?

00:56:21.715 --> 00:56:23.116
It's your job to keep him posted.

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:27.321
You're a smart guy, right?
I can only tell you what he tells me to.

00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:30.991
How long will you make me wait!

00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:32.659
Just for one meeting...

00:56:33.894 --> 00:56:35.729
I don't have the time or money for this.

00:56:36.663 --> 00:56:38.632
-Please, sir.
-Then why do you keep coming, sir?

00:56:39.399 --> 00:56:41.802
Do you know Ratan Tata, Mahesh?

00:56:41.935 --> 00:56:45.439
He waited here for 20 years
to start Tata Airlines.

00:56:45.572 --> 00:56:47.641
He failed.
And you are a nobody, Mahesh.

00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:51.178
Get going.
Understand, man.

00:56:53.413 --> 00:56:54.982
Don't show up next week!

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.656
Either pay the interest
or give your house to Ravi.

00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:06.860
Don't you trust us?
We will return your money.

00:57:07.094 --> 00:57:10.430
Painting charges ate up all our money!
Just two lakhs left!

00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:14.701
A scientist's amazing journey
from Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

00:57:14.835 --> 00:57:18.105
A special interview
with President Abdul Kalam

00:57:18.205 --> 00:57:23.010
by Chitra Ramarao,
our senior news reporter from Chennai.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:24.578
This is All India Radio.

00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.780
An amazing journey
from Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:29.016
Damn!
So much security!

00:57:29.149 --> 00:57:31.151
-If we get caught, we're doomed!
-We won't.

00:57:31.218 --> 00:57:33.854
That stupid bet was a joke!

00:57:34.154 --> 00:57:35.689
This isn't like meeting Paresh
on a jet!

00:57:35.822 --> 00:57:38.058
We can't just sneak in
through the door!

00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:40.460
Can I tell you something?
I learned it from my experience.

00:57:40.527 --> 00:57:44.298
If the door's ajar,
don't just get a foot in. Dash in!

00:57:44.398 --> 00:57:47.835
I can't lie to the President, Mahesh.
Hello!

00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:50.037
It's not wrong to lie
for a good cause.

00:57:50.704 --> 00:57:54.808
-Falsehood takes on truth's nature.
-What?

00:57:54.908 --> 00:57:57.744
It is said so in the Bhagavad Gita!
The man inside knows it well! Madam.

00:57:57.878 --> 00:57:59.847
It's not news
if I don't meet him.

00:57:59.913 --> 00:58:00.581
-But...
-Sir, this way.

00:58:00.647 --> 00:58:01.448
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:05.285
If I do meet him,
you get an exclusive headline!

00:58:07.221 --> 00:58:09.623
Do you really think I'm convinced?

00:58:09.756 --> 00:58:13.594
I'm staking everything to do this

00:58:13.727 --> 00:58:19.066
only because I'm just another sheep
among a billion here!

00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:21.702
And I hope you won't become one.

00:58:21.835 --> 00:58:22.903
-You better deliver...
-Excuse me, ma'am.

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.771
- ...on your promises.
-Please follow me.

00:58:26.006 --> 00:58:27.174
Ma'am, papers, please.

00:58:30.377 --> 00:58:31.078
One second.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.584
-This is for...
-Thank You.

00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:40.020
Mr. Raghunandan.
My voice recordist.

00:58:45.158 --> 00:58:45.993
Just a pen.

00:58:47.127 --> 00:58:50.964
By the way, don't quote anything inside.
You were doing it all wrong!

00:58:51.632 --> 00:58:55.402
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
This is my voice recordist, Raghunandan.

00:58:55.469 --> 00:58:56.770
Raghunandan, Raghunandan.

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.773
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
This is my voice recordist, Raghunandan.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:00.507
This way, please.

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:03.777
Your ID?

00:59:04.545 --> 00:59:06.013
-Sir, your ID, please.
-Yeah.

00:59:06.313 --> 00:59:08.715
See, actually, we both are a team.
This is my ID.

00:59:09.249 --> 00:59:10.884
Sir, I need to see your ID.

00:59:10.984 --> 00:59:12.586
Raghunandan, voice recordist.

00:59:12.653 --> 00:59:13.754
Sir, your photo ID, please.

00:59:13.887 --> 00:59:15.756
See, we have documentation
from downstairs.

00:59:15.889 --> 00:59:17.558
-No, ma'am!
-Sir, I'm not from the radio station.

00:59:17.624 --> 00:59:18.992
I'm Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam.
I just need two minutes.

00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:20.961
-Please let me see him, sir. Please, sir.
-No, you are not allowed.

00:59:21.028 --> 00:59:21.728
Please listen to me.
Sir.

00:59:21.795 --> 00:59:24.464
If I could make
a two days trip in two hours,

00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.133
I would've seen my father alive!

00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:29.436
I want to start a low cost airline,
but they won't let me, sir!

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:30.604
-Sir!
-Mister?

00:59:30.737 --> 00:59:31.638
Are you a Telugu?

00:59:32.072 --> 00:59:32.739
Yes, sir!

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.008
I just need two minutes of your time!

00:59:35.142 --> 00:59:37.077
After that, if you think I'm wrong,
have me arrested!

00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:40.414
-Dhanraj, please let him in.
-Yes, sir!

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:44.952
Security under control.

00:59:54.928 --> 00:59:56.129
-Good day, sir.
-Greetings, sir.

00:59:56.263 --> 00:59:57.264
Greetings!

00:59:58.031 --> 00:59:59.933
I'm from a small village
near Tsundur.

01:00:01.034 --> 01:00:02.669
My father was a government school teacher.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:07.808
Hello?

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.276
-Maha.-Mom?

01:00:10.077 --> 01:00:10.944
Mom?

01:00:12.546 --> 01:00:16.216
Your father's been bedridden
for two weeks now.

01:00:18.352 --> 01:00:22.389
He's holding on just to see you.

01:00:24.024 --> 01:00:27.361
The doctor says he won't survive.

01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:32.232
Tell dad I'll be home tomorrow by 11 AM.

01:00:32.366 --> 01:00:34.701
My son, Maha!

01:00:34.835 --> 01:00:37.070
-I'll be there! Be brave!
-Hurry!

01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:39.339
-I'll come, Mom!
-Come soon!

01:00:41.742 --> 01:00:42.743
Oh, God.

01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:45.679
-Be careful.
-For the flight fare!

01:00:45.812 --> 01:00:47.314
Hurry!
You can catch the 8 pm flight!

01:00:47.414 --> 01:00:49.316
-I'll do the money order.
-Shut up!

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:54.054
This is 6,000.
The ticket is for 11,200 business-class.

01:00:56.223 --> 01:00:58.792
Economy costs 6,000, right?

01:00:59.226 --> 01:01:00.594
Those are fully booked now, sir.

01:01:00.661 --> 01:01:01.795
Excuse me, sir. Please.

01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:02.596
No...

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.731
Is there anything else you can do?

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:07.000
-I'm sorry. We don't give discounts.
-Any cancellation?

01:01:07.067 --> 01:01:08.435
Sir, here you go with your money.

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:09.703
Please move.

01:01:09.803 --> 01:01:10.871
-I need...
-Sir, try and understand.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:11.939
Please move aside.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:12.940
Ma'am, please.

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:14.107
-Excuse me.
-Sir.

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:16.109
My dad's unwell.
I need to meet him.

01:01:16.243 --> 01:01:18.512
I only have 6,000, but she is asking me
to take a first-class...

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:19.713
Please move. They're waiting.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.316
Alright! I'll get the money.
How much time do I have?

01:01:22.816 --> 01:01:24.518
-My God!
-How much time do I have?

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:26.520
Five minutes.

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:27.955
Excuse me.

01:01:28.088 --> 01:01:29.389
Move, now.

01:01:29.723 --> 01:01:31.225
When is the next flight?

01:01:33.227 --> 01:01:34.728
When is it?

01:01:35.395 --> 01:01:36.196
In two days.

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:38.732
Oh, God! The smell.

01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:41.168
Please move aside, sir!

01:01:42.569 --> 01:01:43.770
Two days!

01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:45.739
Two...

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:48.308
Sir. Sir. Sir.

01:01:48.675 --> 01:01:51.144
My father's unwell, sir.
I need to buy a ticket.

01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:52.946
It's urgent.
It's an emergency, sir.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.482
When you're flying,
you should bring money.

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:56.216
Okay?

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:00.087
Ma'am.

01:02:00.153 --> 01:02:01.655
Ma'am, If you can
please help me.

01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:03.323
Sir, I need to get this ticket.

01:02:03.624 --> 01:02:06.193
-Can you help me with some more money?
-Sorry mister, no.

01:02:06.627 --> 01:02:07.561
Is he mad?

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:08.695
Crazy people.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:20.140
Ma'am.

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:21.675
Time is running out.

01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:23.310
My father is not well.
It's an emergency.

01:02:23.443 --> 01:02:25.045
-Boarding closes in five minutes.
-No, just leave.

01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:27.814
I need to go to Hyderabad.
The last plane leaves in five minutes.

01:02:28.982 --> 01:02:30.017
Sir.

01:02:30.851 --> 01:02:32.753
It's an emergency.
My father is very sick.

01:02:32.819 --> 01:02:34.621
I need to see him.
I don't have money for a ticket.

01:02:34.721 --> 01:02:36.490
-Please give him some, dad.
-Sir, at 11 o'clock...

01:02:36.623 --> 01:02:39.026
Gautam, just shut up
and read your comic.

01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:41.028
Please lend me the money!

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:41.962
I can give you...

01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:43.630
I can give you my gold ring!

01:02:43.697 --> 01:02:45.299
I can give you my address
and phone number.

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:47.201
Sir, please.
Please understand!

01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:48.836
Security!
What's with this nuisance?

01:02:48.902 --> 01:02:49.570
Sir, please help me.

01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:51.338
Sir, I can...
I can show you my...

01:02:51.405 --> 01:02:53.073
I'm an '87 batch Air Force Officer.

01:02:53.207 --> 01:02:55.909
Please can somebody understand?
Can somebody please help me?

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:59.279
Give me your address and phone number,
I can definitely give the money back.

01:02:59.346 --> 01:03:00.247
I promise. I promise.

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.683
I really need this money.
Boarding closes in five minutes!

01:03:02.816 --> 01:03:04.484
I'm Chandra Mahesh.
House number 7,

01:03:05.485 --> 01:03:08.188
Anjaneyaswami temple street,
Kullupalam,

01:03:08.322 --> 01:03:11.491
Tsundur, Guntur district-522318.

01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:12.593
This is my address, please.

01:03:12.726 --> 01:03:14.761
I will come
and give you the money back.

01:03:14.995 --> 01:03:16.563
Someone, please help me!

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.931
-Sir, please help me.
-Hey.

01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:18.966
Don't touch my bag.

01:03:19.032 --> 01:03:20.234
Sir, please help me.

01:03:20.834 --> 01:03:21.735
Ma'am.

01:03:24.238 --> 01:03:25.606
My father is on the deathbed.

01:03:26.173 --> 01:03:28.175
I must see him.
Please help me, ma'am!

01:03:28.275 --> 01:03:31.178
Sir, I don't want to beg here!
But I need to be on that plane!

01:03:31.245 --> 01:03:33.213
I need to see my father.
I need to go, sir.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.382
I'm running out of time.
Somebody, please help me!

01:03:35.516 --> 01:03:37.150
Somebody, please help me!

01:03:37.217 --> 01:03:39.720
-My mother's old and alone!
-Come out, I say!

01:03:39.853 --> 01:03:42.756
I must be on that plane.
My father is on the deathbed.

01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:45.692
I must be on that plane.

01:03:54.568 --> 01:03:55.936
What's wrong?

01:03:57.404 --> 01:04:00.407
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. Let me check.

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.744
SHRI RENUKA YALLAMMATALLI LORRY SERVICES

01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:11.585
You're a bloody failure!
And will always be one!

01:04:37.678 --> 01:04:38.679
Who is it?

01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:50.757
You taught thousands to write
and you can barely scribble now!

01:04:55.696 --> 01:04:58.498
The train has to stop here!

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:01.168
I can't open my eye, Maha!

01:05:25.392 --> 01:05:26.994
You were his only child

01:05:29.162 --> 01:05:32.566
and you couldn't even light his pyre!

01:05:39.907 --> 01:05:41.041
Why did you come?

01:05:42.342 --> 01:05:45.312
Why the hell did you come?

01:05:45.379 --> 01:05:48.582
Why the hell did you come?

01:05:50.184 --> 01:05:53.687
Why did you come
after everything's over?

01:05:55.822 --> 01:05:57.891
This is all my fate!

01:06:01.395 --> 01:06:04.932
He longed for you
until the very end!

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:12.539
Had you just seen him once

01:06:12.673 --> 01:06:15.475
he would've gone peacefully!

01:06:16.043 --> 01:06:18.946
He said you wouldn't want
to speak to a failure!

01:06:19.079 --> 01:06:21.381
You deserted us
and walked away.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:23.617
He waited until the end
for your return.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.087
Let go of my feet!

01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:31.158
-We both had such high hopes with you!
-Father.

01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:35.229
The breath he held on to,

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:40.234
imagining you were back,
will never return!

01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:42.769
He died waiting for you!

01:06:42.903 --> 01:06:45.138
You bloody wretch!

01:06:45.272 --> 01:06:47.608
-Those who are executed get one last wish.
-I didn't have enough money.

01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:49.376
You deprived him of that, too!

01:06:49.476 --> 01:06:54.781
You never understood him.
See it for yourself.

01:06:54.915 --> 01:06:57.050
You can read, right? Read them.

01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:58.785
Go ahead!

01:06:58.919 --> 01:07:00.454
Read them all!

01:07:00.888 --> 01:07:04.291
Today, my son left home.

01:07:04.424 --> 01:07:09.096
Though obstacles be many,
he will overcome them all!

01:07:09.229 --> 01:07:12.099
Take it!
Take it and read it!

01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:17.404
This is what he scribbled
when he was dying!

01:07:17.504 --> 01:07:20.407
"Parvathi says he'll fly.

01:07:20.507 --> 01:07:24.611
But I know he won't rest
until he makes everyone fly with him."

01:07:24.745 --> 01:07:28.081
He imagined you reaching great heights!

01:07:28.182 --> 01:07:31.351
You broke his heart!

01:07:31.485 --> 01:07:34.087
"They say a sparrow can never aspire
to fly high.

01:07:34.188 --> 01:07:36.924
But my son will change that!"

01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:38.959
He had so much faith in you.

01:07:39.092 --> 01:07:43.497
You sinner! You failed to understand a man
who understood you so well!

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:49.269
He always said,
"Time is the most valuable asset".

01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:53.640
If you can't reach in time,
what's the point of your love or money?

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.775
Why?

01:07:56.009 --> 01:07:58.879
He was hard on you
only for your own good.

01:07:59.646 --> 01:08:01.515
Was that wrong?

01:08:02.015 --> 01:08:04.484
Is that why you punished him?

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:06.653
He didn't lose!

01:08:07.054 --> 01:08:09.656
When you win,
it is his victory, too.

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:11.825
I'll never be angry again, Mother.

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:13.694
I'll never be angry again.

01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:18.999
Next three years at the Air Force,
I had just one thought.

01:08:23.003 --> 01:08:24.404
To make the common man fly.

01:08:35.716 --> 01:08:37.317
Why go to the President for this?

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.888
I could've done this for you.

01:08:41.655 --> 01:08:43.257
Anyway, all the best.

01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:50.931
Move round and round
Like a surging hurricane!

01:08:51.064 --> 01:08:54.768
Stomp over arrogance
Like a bull off its leash!

01:08:58.205 --> 01:09:01.842
A streak like the lightning
Tear it all down

01:09:01.942 --> 01:09:05.546
Punch it and spread to dry
Then, dust it off and toss it out

01:09:16.023 --> 01:09:17.357
Mr. Balaiyya!

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:21.395
When aviation is so down,
you're expanding your airlines!

01:09:21.528 --> 01:09:25.132
The new aviation minister says
he'll give no handouts.

01:09:25.232 --> 01:09:26.700
-What do you think?
-Hey Trivedi!

01:09:26.767 --> 01:09:28.869
One must take risks to win!

01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:30.370
I need no handouts, chump!

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.473
My beer company's enough
to bail me out!

01:09:33.574 --> 01:09:34.241
Hey, Paresh!

01:09:34.374 --> 01:09:36.877
-What is this 'aero show'?
-A flight exhibition, uncle!

01:09:36.977 --> 01:09:38.412
Like our town fair!

01:09:38.545 --> 01:09:41.381
-Is our plane here?
-I'll bring them in from Malaysia!

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:42.749
We got our license!

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:46.053
-Let's go closer!
-When do our planes arrive?

01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:49.189
It'll be here in a week, sir.

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:51.692
Paresh!

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.628
Expanding your flights, huh?

01:09:54.761 --> 01:09:57.464
I can't take risks like you, my friend.

01:09:58.398 --> 01:10:00.634
I came to check out turboprops
for cargo.

01:10:00.767 --> 01:10:02.970
Our planes await us at Malaysia.

01:10:04.338 --> 01:10:05.839
There's Paresh!

01:10:05.973 --> 01:10:08.509
Why did Prakash Babu
bring that halfwit here?

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:11.411
Teacher and student.

01:10:11.512 --> 01:10:13.347
Oh, so he's that guy!

01:10:13.647 --> 01:10:15.549
He looks like a nice chap.

01:10:17.251 --> 01:10:19.152
So obviously, he's doomed!

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.089
Let's sit back and enjoy it!

01:10:23.190 --> 01:10:25.292
You know a bumble bee, Balaiyya?

01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:29.196
It's not designed aerodynamically.

01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:33.166
Yet, it flies!

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.501
Do you know why?

01:10:34.835 --> 01:10:38.539
Because it doesn't know that
it can't fly!

01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:42.109
Make sure he learns that now.

01:10:47.714 --> 01:10:49.016
Baby, who is it?

01:10:50.884 --> 01:10:52.786
Che says, "Call me".

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.355
-Our planes are leaving, Maha!-What?

01:10:55.489 --> 01:10:57.057
PlaneAm canceled our deal!

01:10:57.357 --> 01:10:59.493
They're taking their planes
in three days!

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.794
Why?

01:11:01.195 --> 01:11:04.665
The Indian DGCA is asking them
for Boeing blueprints!

01:11:05.332 --> 01:11:06.600
Hundreds of Boeings fly in India!

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:08.735
No one's asked them for blueprints!

01:11:08.869 --> 01:11:11.004
They told us to check with the government!

01:11:11.138 --> 01:11:14.208
PlaneAm's levied a fifty lakh fine
for blocking their flights!

01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:16.343
Why is Indian DGCA targeting us?

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:17.377
Maha?

01:11:19.179 --> 01:11:20.681
Pay up, sir!

01:11:20.814 --> 01:11:21.815
I'll pay.

01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:46.406
I'll take an auto rickshaw!

01:11:55.048 --> 01:11:58.752
The new by-law was passed last week.

01:11:58.886 --> 01:11:59.786
Didn't you know?

01:12:00.087 --> 01:12:01.522
Will Boeing give their blueprints?

01:12:02.456 --> 01:12:04.358
Will any company
reveal their trade secrets?

01:12:05.392 --> 01:12:06.894
How can you change rules suddenly?

01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:08.362
Calm down, Mr. Chandra Mahesh.

01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:10.264
Laws can't be changed for you.

01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:12.099
But you will, for the rich, right?

01:12:15.802 --> 01:12:17.604
My money's gone.

01:12:17.738 --> 01:12:18.639
That's not my problem.

01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:20.307
It's your headache.

01:12:21.408 --> 01:12:23.177
The DGCA has just done its job.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.479
-Are you bloody screwing with me!
-Watch your words.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.915
Why do you want
to start an airline?

01:12:28.415 --> 01:12:30.350
-Go home and graze your cows!
-Mahesh!

01:12:30.717 --> 01:12:33.587
Go pimp for Jaz Air!
I can break your damn neck!

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.256
But I'm being patient
and you keep fucking with me?

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.425
Let him go!
Listen to me!

01:12:45.766 --> 01:12:47.267
-Prakash sir.
-Hey, Mahesh.

01:12:47.434 --> 01:12:48.969
I've been trying for days
to see you!

01:12:49.102 --> 01:12:50.504
They've changed the laws!

01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:53.273
PlaneAm's ending the deal
and demanding a penalty!

01:12:53.407 --> 01:12:55.976
We'll lose our planes!
If you could loan me fifty lakhs...

01:12:56.109 --> 01:12:59.346
647.38 crores.

01:12:59.479 --> 01:13:01.481
No, sir.
I only asked for fifty lakhs.

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:06.620
Six hundred and forty seven
point thirty eight crores.

01:13:07.087 --> 01:13:07.788
Sir?

01:13:08.155 --> 01:13:10.490
That's Mr. Paresh's income

01:13:11.658 --> 01:13:15.796
from his travel agency alone
every year.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:21.768
And you wanted him to join you
and destroy his own business.

01:13:22.102 --> 01:13:23.370
He taught you a lesson.

01:13:25.472 --> 01:13:26.807
You still don't get it?

01:13:28.175 --> 01:13:33.046
Paresh is the main angel investor
of SCI.

01:13:34.014 --> 01:13:38.652
Not just SCI, he also controls
people like me in it.

01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:40.487
Prakash, come here.

01:13:42.723 --> 01:13:44.958
While you came to me
asking for a few lakhs

01:13:45.325 --> 01:13:49.329
look how easily he crushed you!

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.331
Yes, that's Paresh.

01:13:52.299 --> 01:13:56.036
By the time you settle your debt,

01:13:56.503 --> 01:13:58.272
you'll be finished.

01:13:58.572 --> 01:14:00.407
But your idea?

01:14:01.241 --> 01:14:02.242
Fantastic!

01:14:03.043 --> 01:14:04.945
Never occurred to us!

01:14:05.812 --> 01:14:06.647
Check that out!

01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:12.719
Your PlaneAm aircraft.

01:14:14.421 --> 01:14:15.088
Mahesh!

01:14:15.856 --> 01:14:21.061
We can break and make laws in a day!

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:26.466
He spent just ten minutes
thinking about you

01:14:28.068 --> 01:14:29.436
and you're finished!

01:14:30.504 --> 01:14:32.773
Don't make him think anymore, my boy!

01:14:36.376 --> 01:14:37.044
Good luck.

01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:29.429
Paresh!

01:15:31.231 --> 01:15:32.699
-Where the hell is Paresh?
-Oh, no.

01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:35.936
Where is Paresh!

01:15:36.236 --> 01:15:37.404
Bloody bastard!

01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:44.311
Paresh!

01:17:07.528 --> 01:17:10.264
Didn't I tell you he would ruin your life?

01:17:10.531 --> 01:17:13.267
How can I relax
with you married to this nut?

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.569
Only God can save him now!

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:19.373
How long will he live off you?
Are you listening to me?

01:17:19.573 --> 01:17:21.675
It's really shameful.

01:17:21.775 --> 01:17:25.078
The cow's been mooing all day!
Go check, you moron!

01:17:25.345 --> 01:17:27.181
You don't own a cow.

01:17:27.281 --> 01:17:29.416
She means me, fool!

01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:31.652
Here. I came to give you this.

01:17:31.752 --> 01:17:34.354
An arrogant shrew
with a worthless husband.

01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:36.757
Keep it.

01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:39.293
Take her and leave.

01:17:39.426 --> 01:17:41.094
Some daughter, she is. A witch!

01:17:41.228 --> 01:17:42.729
Put the cake down.

01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:45.532
What a loser husband. Let's go.

01:17:46.099 --> 01:17:48.101
-Mom, the bags.
-Shut up and come!

01:17:54.474 --> 01:17:55.976
You haven't eaten all day.

01:17:56.577 --> 01:17:59.079
I didn't see you come in.
When did you come?

01:18:03.116 --> 01:18:06.520
Maha, Seenu uncle
from next door came by.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:10.557
His kids want to join a tutorial center
for IAS exams.

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:13.694
He feels you would teach them better.

01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:15.662
What do you say?

01:18:20.067 --> 01:18:21.435
They're smart kids.

01:18:22.836 --> 01:18:25.639
It'll help you take your mind off this.

01:18:27.074 --> 01:18:28.842
Uncle said he'd pay you.

01:18:30.444 --> 01:18:31.111
I knew it.

01:18:31.812 --> 01:18:33.413
I knew you would eventually get there.

01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:35.349
Get where, Maha?

01:18:40.254 --> 01:18:41.121
What is it now?

01:18:41.788 --> 01:18:43.557
Pointing out I'm a freeloader, huh?

01:18:44.892 --> 01:18:46.093
Did I say that?

01:18:46.326 --> 01:18:49.196
How much did Seenu uncle offer
to help you out?

01:18:50.797 --> 01:18:53.834
Your mom was right about you blabbing
when hungry.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:58.071
Stop treating me like an idiot!
At least, your mom was direct!

01:18:59.139 --> 01:19:00.774
Why are you fighting with me?

01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:03.043
Let's figure out your next move.

01:19:09.016 --> 01:19:11.084
Oh, yeah, must figure that out.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.290
Gee, I wonder why that didn't occur
to this dimwit!

01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:25.332
Enlighten me on how to run an airline,
baker girl.

01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:26.233
Go ahead.

01:19:27.568 --> 01:19:28.702
I'm all ears.

01:19:30.404 --> 01:19:33.874
Every time you met investors
with your idea

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:37.110
they laughed at you, didn't they?

01:19:38.011 --> 01:19:40.581
To them, your idea
was just a damn cupcake!

01:19:42.549 --> 01:19:46.787
And what you demean
puts food on our table.

01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:51.091
Despite my family's objections,
I married you.

01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:54.461
I believed you'd make the poor fly!

01:19:55.262 --> 01:19:56.630
Is it all just talk?

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.866
Are you going work
towards it at all!

01:19:59.132 --> 01:20:00.601
Make it happen!

01:20:01.869 --> 01:20:04.705
Don't mope around like a loser, Maha!

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.275
Why do you want to live with a loser?

01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:10.744
Get lost!

01:20:11.512 --> 01:20:12.446
Go away!

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.148
Achieve something and then get macho!

01:20:15.616 --> 01:20:16.750
Fucking ego!

01:20:52.319 --> 01:20:56.290
My love!

01:21:01.428 --> 01:21:05.766
My love!

01:21:09.837 --> 01:21:13.974
Love of my life!

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:18.212
Baby?

01:21:18.478 --> 01:21:21.815
As darkness falls

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:25.252
My heart races

01:21:25.519 --> 01:21:28.488
My eyes are exhausted

01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:32.860
From seeking you far and wide

01:21:32.993 --> 01:21:38.999
I yearn to be beside you

01:21:40.033 --> 01:21:43.637
I dream of resting

01:21:43.704 --> 01:21:47.107
On your shoulder

01:21:47.207 --> 01:21:48.475
My heart calls out for you

01:21:48.542 --> 01:21:50.043
Did Baby come here, Seby?

01:21:50.644 --> 01:21:51.712
No, Maha.

01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:58.352
Only you can take my breath away

01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:01.622
And you know it too

01:22:46.366 --> 01:22:49.236
My cursed hand

01:22:49.369 --> 01:22:51.805
My cursed hand

01:22:51.872 --> 01:22:55.676
I raised against you...

01:22:55.776 --> 01:22:59.947
O forgive me

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:05.285
My anger has faded away

01:23:05.419 --> 01:23:08.288
Come back to me

01:23:11.425 --> 01:23:12.626
Where will I go, Maha?

01:23:14.127 --> 01:23:15.028
This is my home.

01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.497
My only home.

01:23:17.598 --> 01:23:21.068
My love

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:27.074
I looked for you everywhere.

01:23:27.341 --> 01:23:29.142
I would have kept you running
for days

01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:31.478
if I wasn't pregnant.

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:38.218
Who breaks such news in this way?

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:41.421
Can't you talk like a normal person?

01:23:42.456 --> 01:23:44.491
I can't. This is who I am.

01:23:45.058 --> 01:23:46.827
And only then,
it gets into your thick skull!

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:01.808
Baby!

01:24:05.846 --> 01:24:06.847
To hell with the net...

01:25:06.173 --> 01:25:08.375
Damn sparrows!
Why don't they eat?

01:25:08.675 --> 01:25:12.279
The bigger birds will eat it all
and leave them hungry.

01:25:14.014 --> 01:25:17.518
A sparrow is neither too big
nor flies too high.

01:25:19.152 --> 01:25:21.655
And so needs very less food.

01:25:30.898 --> 01:25:31.565
Baby!

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:33.834
-What is it, Maha?
-Come with me.

01:25:52.352 --> 01:25:53.453
For its size

01:25:54.721 --> 01:25:56.123
and the height it flies...

01:25:57.524 --> 01:25:58.892
it doesn't need much food.

01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:02.196
So...

01:26:04.031 --> 01:26:05.899
Not much fuel.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:08.135
Small planes!
Turboprops!

01:26:08.468 --> 01:26:09.136
Baby!

01:26:09.469 --> 01:26:11.271
Small planes need less fuel.

01:26:11.872 --> 01:26:13.540
So tickets can be even cheaper.

01:26:13.774 --> 01:26:18.011
I'll convert cargo planes
into passenger ones! A first in India!

01:26:21.248 --> 01:26:25.319
Our turboprops are the best in the market.

01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:27.921
But large planes have replaced turboprops
everywhere.

01:26:28.155 --> 01:26:30.624
Your planes are used
only for cargo transport.

01:26:30.757 --> 01:26:33.293
I'll turn your cargos into
passenger planes. Joint venture.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.629
What is this 'tur-bur' you speak of?

01:26:35.796 --> 01:26:36.997
Turboprops, uncle!

01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:40.133
They're like the small Maruti 800 cars.

01:26:40.267 --> 01:26:42.269
They only fly half as high as big planes.

01:26:42.436 --> 01:26:44.805
Fuel cost also gets halved.

01:26:44.938 --> 01:26:46.940
Won't they be cramped?

01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:48.775
Yes, the planes are small.

01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.378
But they will also get full
with just 70 people.

01:26:51.712 --> 01:26:54.681
Large planes need 200 passengers
to get full.

01:26:54.982 --> 01:26:58.886
Therefore, low costs and high profits.

01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:01.889
You want us to give our planes to you
for free? Why should we?

01:27:01.989 --> 01:27:03.857
7,500 trains operate in my country,
every day.

01:27:04.157 --> 01:27:06.360
That's 25 million passengers a day.

01:27:06.493 --> 01:27:09.263
Plus, there are several private
and government bus services.

01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:13.800
If just two percent of these people
fly in our airline,

01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:15.536
ours would be a profitable business.

01:27:15.802 --> 01:27:17.738
Can't fly too far with turboprops, sir.

01:27:17.905 --> 01:27:20.474
We can't do prestige routes
like Chennai to Delhi.

01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:22.042
Must it be a non-stop to Delhi?

01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:25.445
Make stops at Vijayawada and Nagpur
and voila!

01:27:25.546 --> 01:27:29.783
We cover big cities and small towns.
That's the strength of a sparrow.

01:27:29.883 --> 01:27:32.719
If we share costs with Turboprop company,
in a joint venture

01:27:32.853 --> 01:27:34.188
four crores will suffice!

01:27:34.454 --> 01:27:37.191
Tea bill of 200 bucks is still due.

01:27:37.324 --> 01:27:40.661
It's about to rain millions
and you're asking for 200 bucks!

01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:42.829
-Get lost!
-Yeah, right!

01:27:42.963 --> 01:27:45.199
You can't even pay 200,
but dreaming of making crores!

01:27:48.702 --> 01:27:49.970
I'll take these with me.

01:27:53.674 --> 01:27:55.676
I listened to you
and set up shop here.

01:27:56.043 --> 01:27:58.011
I was worried it wouldn't take off.

01:27:58.345 --> 01:28:01.548
I expected 300-400 bucks tops,
but I make over a 1,000!

01:28:01.815 --> 01:28:02.749
A thousand?

01:28:03.483 --> 01:28:04.184
Per week?

01:28:04.718 --> 01:28:06.153
No!
Per day!

01:28:06.854 --> 01:28:09.790
The college girls across the road
come by every day

01:28:10.257 --> 01:28:13.894
and the boys follow them in
like puppies.

01:28:14.428 --> 01:28:16.363
My shop's in the right place.

01:28:16.897 --> 01:28:18.065
Whose idea was that?

01:28:18.632 --> 01:28:19.299
Shall we go?

01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:21.835
Not bad, Maha.

01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:25.339
I thought you were the only one
following girls to bakeries.

01:28:25.539 --> 01:28:27.474
But most boys are, too.

01:28:28.141 --> 01:28:29.309
Isn't it time for work?

01:28:29.643 --> 01:28:32.479
Let's eat. I've ordered fritters.
I'm craving for one!

01:28:32.579 --> 01:28:34.414
A coffee, bro.
Lots of sugar.

01:28:38.619 --> 01:28:40.320
-No, thanks.
-What's wrong, Maha?

01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:43.991
Paresh isn't in India this month.

01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:46.727
We must bring in our planes secretively
before he's back.

01:28:47.127 --> 01:28:47.861
How?

01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:50.030
Ground work and feasibility reports
are done.

01:28:50.197 --> 01:28:52.232
I even had a meeting
with a French company.

01:28:53.367 --> 01:28:55.969
If we do this correctly,
we'll be up and running.

01:28:56.603 --> 01:28:59.039
We don't even need eight crores.
Just four will do.

01:28:59.473 --> 01:29:01.542
Why wait? Start.

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:04.044
We can!

01:29:05.212 --> 01:29:08.081
But only after the company's registered,
can this take off.

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:14.955
Ba-Baby?

01:29:15.722 --> 01:29:17.491
Can you lend me fifteen thousand?

01:29:28.068 --> 01:29:30.571
Is that my coffee?
Lots of sugar?

01:29:30.971 --> 01:29:32.339
-For registration...
-Give me the bill.

01:29:33.907 --> 01:29:36.844
Just pay the registration fee.
I can finalize the deal.

01:29:38.111 --> 01:29:39.646
This time, I'll succeed.

01:29:41.315 --> 01:29:42.749
I'll repay you in three months.

01:29:43.917 --> 01:29:46.353
I'll keep accounts.
You keep track of it, too.

01:29:55.162 --> 01:29:56.230
Baby...

01:30:07.074 --> 01:30:07.774
Good morning, sir.

01:30:12.346 --> 01:30:13.013
Maha!

01:30:13.947 --> 01:30:14.982
Never mind 15,000

01:30:15.249 --> 01:30:16.149
I'll give you 20,000.

01:30:16.783 --> 01:30:18.452
You talk of doing great things.

01:30:19.019 --> 01:30:20.888
Act accordingly.

01:30:21.822 --> 01:30:23.524
Why all this false pride with me?

01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:32.199
Sorry.

01:30:34.735 --> 01:30:35.402
What?

01:30:36.703 --> 01:30:39.006
Why is it so hard
to ask your wife for help?

01:30:39.339 --> 01:30:40.207
I've said this already!

01:30:40.507 --> 01:30:42.843
My bakery is yours
and your planes are mine.

01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:44.044
Isn't that our deal?

01:31:31.358 --> 01:31:33.560
One tasty sweet for the boss lady.

01:31:48.675 --> 01:31:49.343
Bhawar?

01:31:54.815 --> 01:31:55.482
Hey!

01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:57.885
-Yes, sir!
-How?

01:31:59.553 --> 01:32:02.222
You're a goddamn pauper.

01:32:02.656 --> 01:32:04.725
How can you sleep so peacefully?

01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:07.661
Brother, come.

01:32:08.328 --> 01:32:10.764
Something's not right.

01:32:11.098 --> 01:32:12.065
Is there a problem?

01:32:12.399 --> 01:32:14.635
Relax, Paresh. All is well.

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:18.038
Just a small glitch with turboprops.
We'll sort it tomorrow. Okay?

01:32:18.172 --> 01:32:20.207
How many times have I told you?

01:32:20.674 --> 01:32:23.043
Good news can wait.

01:32:23.443 --> 01:32:25.345
But problems,
tell me right away.

01:32:25.712 --> 01:32:27.347
The planes we wanted for cargo

01:32:27.481 --> 01:32:29.983
have been taken by someone
as passenger planes.

01:32:30.117 --> 01:32:31.385
Ask Mirza to talk.

01:32:31.852 --> 01:32:33.787
And if they do not agree,
make them agree!

01:32:33.921 --> 01:32:37.024
Isn't passenger transport
a better offer for them?

01:32:37.157 --> 01:32:39.126
Pay them more than what we promised.

01:32:39.459 --> 01:32:41.762
They're not interested.

01:32:42.362 --> 01:32:43.197
Call Ananth.

01:32:43.463 --> 01:32:44.598
It's 3 AM, Paresh!

01:32:44.665 --> 01:32:47.000
So?
I'm awake! Why should he sleep?

01:32:52.806 --> 01:32:53.473
What is this?

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.613
A joint venture
between Turboprop International

01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:01.782
and NCS Aviation Private Limited.

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.853
Registered in the name
of Ms. Sundari.

01:33:06.119 --> 01:33:11.158
With Turboprop in the forefront,
he stayed hidden and sealed the deal.

01:33:11.425 --> 01:33:13.827
I signed
without a second thought as

01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:16.163
only you've been dealing
with turboprops.

01:33:16.396 --> 01:33:17.397
I'm sorry!

01:33:21.168 --> 01:33:22.002
Don't worry, Paresh.

01:33:22.236 --> 01:33:24.338
He's not rich like Balaiyya.

01:33:24.605 --> 01:33:25.539
He's just a fool.

01:33:25.672 --> 01:33:27.841
He'll run away
with his tail between his legs.

01:33:28.342 --> 01:33:29.776
Balaiyya's the fool.

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.213
Once his father's wealth is gone,
he'll disappear.

01:33:34.781 --> 01:33:37.351
Call up whoever, wherever

01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:38.519
but finish him.

01:33:38.652 --> 01:33:39.753
Don't be hasty, Paresh.

01:33:39.887 --> 01:33:42.623
The CBI's still investigating
what we did last time.

01:33:43.056 --> 01:33:44.057
I don't care!

01:33:44.191 --> 01:33:47.127
His plane must not land here.

01:33:47.628 --> 01:33:48.295
Okay?

01:33:49.496 --> 01:33:50.163
Okay.

01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:51.832
Damn villager!

01:33:52.032 --> 01:33:53.700
Yes. That's what he is.

01:33:53.901 --> 01:33:55.669
Not him, me.

01:33:56.703 --> 01:34:01.675
India must only speak
of my story from rags to riches!

01:34:01.775 --> 01:34:04.678
There has to be only one Paresh.
Right?

01:34:04.912 --> 01:34:07.915
No one knows you here,
buddy!

01:34:08.048 --> 01:34:10.050
But everyone seems to know the witch!

01:34:10.184 --> 01:34:11.885
-How are you?
-I'm good!

01:34:12.019 --> 01:34:13.187
How are you, brother?

01:34:13.687 --> 01:34:15.255
I was just praising you.

01:34:15.389 --> 01:34:17.391
-Take care of the bakery, uncle!
-Sure.

01:34:17.524 --> 01:34:19.793
Mock me all you want.
I'll still cook a feast for you.

01:34:19.927 --> 01:34:21.562
-Please come!
-Sure!

01:34:21.695 --> 01:34:23.430
My sister's getting married
on the 15th.

01:34:23.564 --> 01:34:24.598
Just a minute.

01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:26.466
-Come here.
-Next month?

01:34:26.633 --> 01:34:27.801
-You can go.
-What's up?

01:34:28.902 --> 01:34:30.437
Money's the problem, right?

01:34:30.904 --> 01:34:31.638
Yes. Why?

01:34:31.772 --> 01:34:34.741
Don't worry.
That's no problem at all.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:35.576
Who much?

01:34:36.944 --> 01:34:38.879
I meant 'how much' in English?

01:34:40.581 --> 01:34:42.115
It's okay.
I can handle it.

01:34:42.249 --> 01:34:44.117
Why do you hesitate to ask me?

01:34:44.418 --> 01:34:45.085
Just a minute.

01:34:48.422 --> 01:34:50.557
Here you go.
Take it, son.

01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:51.925
What's the matter?

01:34:56.163 --> 01:35:00.400
11,528 rupees!

01:35:00.934 --> 01:35:04.137
My life savings.

01:35:04.505 --> 01:35:07.107
Take it all and get things going.

01:35:07.407 --> 01:35:08.075
Happy?

01:35:08.609 --> 01:35:12.112
Don't tell Baby about this.
She'll rip me apart.

01:35:12.246 --> 01:35:14.114
-God damn, uncle...
-Quit laughing!

01:35:14.248 --> 01:35:16.250
It's for all of you.
Split it up equally.

01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:19.686
We need three crores
and twenty five lakhs.

01:35:20.654 --> 01:35:25.025
About 2,000 times what you've given us.

01:35:27.027 --> 01:35:28.128
Three crores?

01:35:29.129 --> 01:35:32.099
I don't even know how many zeroes
it has!

01:35:33.934 --> 01:35:35.269
This is all I have.

01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:37.938
Please don't mistake me.

01:35:39.373 --> 01:35:41.141
Won't this do?

01:35:41.275 --> 01:35:42.176
It's not that, Uncle.

01:35:42.743 --> 01:35:43.844
Uncle!

01:35:45.045 --> 01:35:47.548
Your heart's much bigger
than a mere three crores!

01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:51.051
Keep it safe.

01:35:55.522 --> 01:35:56.423
I don't have much...

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.059
-Forget about it.
-Uncle is so generous.

01:36:08.402 --> 01:36:09.503
Come in.
Good morning.

01:36:09.803 --> 01:36:14.875
As a bank manager, I should've called
the income tax department first.

01:36:14.942 --> 01:36:15.676
Sir.

01:36:16.176 --> 01:36:16.944
How much, sir?

01:36:17.544 --> 01:36:18.312
See!

01:36:19.079 --> 01:36:22.482
One and a half lakhs. Twenty thousand.
One lakh. Ten thousand. Five hundred.

01:36:22.583 --> 01:36:26.553
Your account's been receiving
deposits all day from Tsundur!

01:36:29.823 --> 01:36:31.959
-Can I make a call?
-Yeah. Sure.

01:36:38.265 --> 01:36:39.266
Tsundur Post?

01:36:39.399 --> 01:36:40.501
Mahesh's on the line.

01:36:40.601 --> 01:36:44.538
I sent two lakhs to your account.
Did you get it?

01:36:44.671 --> 01:36:45.839
Munnuswamy...

01:36:47.508 --> 01:36:48.675
How did you raise so much?

01:36:48.775 --> 01:36:51.612
I pledged my land to Ravi.

01:36:51.745 --> 01:36:53.080
Give me the phone.

01:36:53.213 --> 01:36:55.082
I postponed my sister's wedding a bit!

01:36:55.215 --> 01:36:58.285
The groom will wait
until you repay.

01:36:58.585 --> 01:36:59.953
You keep going.

01:37:01.121 --> 01:37:04.591
You should've told me.
Why did you go to that bloodsucking Ravi?

01:37:04.725 --> 01:37:06.426
We can't be bystanders

01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:09.897
and see you work hard
to make our lives better.

01:37:11.064 --> 01:37:15.903
It's because you stopped the train,
our land prices have skyrocketed.

01:37:16.036 --> 01:37:17.604
-Let me speak to Mahesh!
-Go on!

01:37:17.738 --> 01:37:21.775
I sold all my paddy and sent
eight thousand rupees. Did you get it?

01:37:21.909 --> 01:37:23.143
-Hold on!
-I did.

01:37:23.277 --> 01:37:24.745
-Yes, he got it.
-Give it to him.

01:37:24.878 --> 01:37:26.213
-Here you go.
-Pipe down.

01:37:26.313 --> 01:37:28.282
Maha, my boy...

01:37:28.916 --> 01:37:29.917
Grandpa...

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.619
I just planted chilies
as there were no rains.

01:37:32.753 --> 01:37:35.088
I could only send 500 rupees.
Did you get it?

01:37:35.822 --> 01:37:37.491
You're struggling without rain.

01:37:39.259 --> 01:37:40.227
Why all this?

01:37:40.327 --> 01:37:42.262
This kid wants to talk to you!

01:37:42.396 --> 01:37:45.332
Talk to him. Here you go.

01:37:45.465 --> 01:37:46.633
-Hello?
-Talk to him.

01:37:47.234 --> 01:37:48.669
How are you, uncle?

01:37:48.735 --> 01:37:51.138
Did you get my money?

01:37:51.405 --> 01:37:52.573
How did you get so much?

01:37:52.673 --> 01:37:55.142
From my piggy bank.

01:37:55.209 --> 01:37:58.145
Take me in your airplanes, too.

01:37:58.278 --> 01:38:02.516
The neighboring towns have donated.
Make your donations right away, residents.

01:38:02.649 --> 01:38:05.352
Stand in line.
Don't cut in.

01:38:05.919 --> 01:38:09.523
Thirty seven thousand. Twelve thousand.
Forty thousand. Thirty one thousand.

01:38:09.656 --> 01:38:11.491
Look properly. It's thirty-one lakhs.

01:38:11.959 --> 01:38:13.227
Thirty-one lakhs?

01:38:13.927 --> 01:38:18.198
Get the airplanes here real soon, my boy!

01:38:18.465 --> 01:38:22.002
I will fly all our people
to my daughter's wedding.

01:38:22.135 --> 01:38:24.605
No, sir.
Let's first get back your lands from Ravi.

01:38:24.705 --> 01:38:26.340
I'll come talk to him myself.

01:38:26.473 --> 01:38:27.641
Maha...

01:38:27.774 --> 01:38:28.442
Mom?

01:38:28.509 --> 01:38:30.377
If you're the teacher's son,
I'm his wife!

01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:33.847
I demanded the documents back
from Ravi.

01:38:33.981 --> 01:38:36.350
He told us to pay up
six months' interest anyway.

01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:38.519
No one can touch us
if we're united.

01:38:38.652 --> 01:38:41.121
Victory or defeat,
it's all in your hands now.

01:38:42.356 --> 01:38:43.991
You'll win, right?

01:38:44.124 --> 01:38:46.527
Your father's always with you.

01:38:46.894 --> 01:38:49.162
We're all praying for you, son.

01:38:49.663 --> 01:38:50.364
Win!

01:38:50.597 --> 01:38:52.733
We're counting on you.

01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:54.434
Win!

01:38:54.968 --> 01:38:56.470
Victory is yours.

01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:58.071
-Shall I hang up?
-Okay, Mom.

01:39:01.408 --> 01:39:03.877
All major airports
are under Paresh's control.

01:39:04.011 --> 01:39:06.680
-You'll land your plane on this airstrip?
-Yes.

01:39:07.014 --> 01:39:08.415
Built in the British era.

01:39:08.549 --> 01:39:11.485
Airstrips for postal delivery
and diplomatic trips.

01:39:11.585 --> 01:39:13.086
People like Nehru have been here.

01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.688
Abandoned unused airstrips?

01:39:15.222 --> 01:39:17.090
How many? Three or four?

01:39:17.224 --> 01:39:17.891
500!

01:39:18.392 --> 01:39:20.060
500 of these exist across India.

01:39:20.194 --> 01:39:21.862
We'll prep them for our planes to land!

01:39:21.995 --> 01:39:26.333
Spark the coal
Which lies within your core!

01:39:26.433 --> 01:39:30.938
Light up your future
With the flames that abound

01:39:31.071 --> 01:39:35.442
Ignore the tornadoes
That stand in your way

01:39:35.576 --> 01:39:40.247
Move forward
And fulfill your dreams

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.852
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

01:39:44.952 --> 01:39:49.423
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

01:39:49.556 --> 01:39:53.961
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

01:39:54.094 --> 01:39:58.599
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

01:39:58.732 --> 01:40:03.070
Tear to shreds, all that obstructs

01:40:03.303 --> 01:40:07.774
Give wings to dreams that trust in you
And soar

01:40:09.977 --> 01:40:11.879
What are you saying, Seby?
Be clear.

01:40:11.979 --> 01:40:14.748
For the first time, Indians can book
plane tickets with credit cards.

01:40:15.048 --> 01:40:17.150
How many Indians have credit cards?

01:40:17.284 --> 01:40:19.453
They all have telephones, right?
That is enough!

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.890
They can call our call center
and book tickets.

01:40:23.223 --> 01:40:27.094
With a PNR number, they pick up tickets
at their bank or supermarket.

01:40:29.429 --> 01:40:30.430
But...

01:40:31.098 --> 01:40:33.634
We are trying this
with publicly owned computers.

01:40:34.067 --> 01:40:37.771
Interworld spends six months
just testing this software!

01:40:37.905 --> 01:40:39.840
-Yeah.
-We don't have that kind of luxury.

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.975
No one else has tried this here.

01:40:42.209 --> 01:40:43.610
This will be the first time in India.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.682
You want to sell your tickets
at the railway counter?

01:40:48.815 --> 01:40:51.919
Why will I agree to take away
my business?

01:40:52.019 --> 01:40:55.455
Every day, there are 10,000 people
in the waiting list for A/C coaches.

01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:57.491
I'll take only those people in my airline.

01:40:57.624 --> 01:41:01.428
Just give me a small space
next to your reservation counter.

01:41:01.628 --> 01:41:03.330
Bottom line is,
they need to travel, right?

01:41:03.463 --> 01:41:07.100
Okay. It's a great idea!
All the very best, Mr. Mahesh.

01:41:21.181 --> 01:41:25.652
Why should victory reach you
When you summon it with a snap?

01:41:25.953 --> 01:41:30.224
How will one understand the difference
Between you and anyone else?

01:41:30.357 --> 01:41:34.828
You need a story, too
Narrate it with pride

01:41:34.962 --> 01:41:39.433
The sweat of your effort
Shall bloom with the fragrance of victory

01:41:39.833 --> 01:41:44.338
Our eyes may be small
But not our dreams

01:41:44.404 --> 01:41:48.842
Let not your limitations
Draw your boundaries

01:41:49.009 --> 01:41:49.676
BISMI MOBILES
SALES & SERVICES

01:41:49.776 --> 01:41:53.514
We won't be born again
After we're one with the earth

01:41:53.847 --> 01:41:55.148
-A call for you.
-What is it called?

01:41:55.249 --> 01:41:57.618
The company's called Deccan Air.
Do you like it?

01:41:58.585 --> 01:41:59.987
-He isn't fit.
-Is he?

01:42:00.087 --> 01:42:02.155
You bugger off.
You come in!

01:42:02.256 --> 01:42:06.493
Write a brand new story,
as your life changes today!

01:42:06.593 --> 01:42:08.362
Deccan Air won't get pilots.

01:42:08.495 --> 01:42:10.531
We paid them three times more
than he did.

01:42:10.664 --> 01:42:11.665
They took it!

01:42:11.765 --> 01:42:15.235
Dismiss all of them next month.

01:42:15.402 --> 01:42:16.069
Brother?

01:42:16.203 --> 01:42:18.705
If I can buy them,
anybody can buy them.

01:42:20.374 --> 01:42:21.408
-Stop it!
-Maha's here!

01:42:21.542 --> 01:42:23.510
The pilots didn't show up!

01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:25.212
-Seby!
-Where's he off to?

01:42:25.345 --> 01:42:26.613
-Wait, I'll tell you!
-Do you get anything he does?

01:42:26.747 --> 01:42:28.782
Where are you going?
None of our pilots came!

01:42:37.224 --> 01:42:39.660
A guy who can buy a government
can buy anyone.

01:42:40.227 --> 01:42:41.228
There are our pilots.

01:42:41.361 --> 01:42:43.964
Retired military aviators
who flew fighter jets for India.

01:42:44.097 --> 01:42:46.300
Retired Pilots?
There is an age limit!

01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:52.806
Let me in on the joke!

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.775
Air Force pilots retire at 57.

01:42:54.908 --> 01:42:56.210
Civilian pilots at 61.

01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:57.878
They can fly for another four years!

01:42:57.978 --> 01:43:00.047
Kickass!
Two can play this game!

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.748
You've upheld Guntur's pride!

01:43:01.882 --> 01:43:04.418
Captain Rajiv Manohar,
coordinated all this.

01:43:04.551 --> 01:43:05.786
Retired as Air Commodore.

01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:25.639
I don't believe this.
Is this how it is done!

01:43:25.772 --> 01:43:28.108
-We need to focus on the airline, uncle!
-Yes, yes!

01:43:42.155 --> 01:43:44.124
-I've been waiting for you.
-Bored at work?

01:43:44.258 --> 01:43:45.993
I have a proposal for you.

01:43:46.126 --> 01:43:47.127
What proposal?

01:43:47.261 --> 01:43:48.328
A business proposal!

01:43:48.829 --> 01:43:50.063
What business?

01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:52.466
Do you do this to all your vendors?

01:43:55.369 --> 01:44:00.274
Let my catering division
take care of your in-flight snacks.

01:44:00.974 --> 01:44:03.644
Logistically impossible
with just one outlet in Madras.

01:44:03.777 --> 01:44:04.578
It is possible!

01:44:05.112 --> 01:44:06.847
Who told you Madras was my only base?

01:44:07.114 --> 01:44:08.248
I have franchises!

01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:12.452
Che's family in Vijayawada.
My brother in Vizakh.

01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:14.354
Projected monthly turnover's ten lakhs!

01:44:14.655 --> 01:44:17.491
That's 1.2 crores per year!

01:44:20.294 --> 01:44:23.263
Welcome to Deccan Air,
Mrs. Sundari Kanayanam!

01:44:23.697 --> 01:44:26.466
Don't expect any special treatment.
Alright?

01:44:26.834 --> 01:44:29.770
You too, don't expect any discounts.
Deal.

01:44:32.706 --> 01:44:34.074
We're talking business!

01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:35.509
Business is done, right?

01:44:37.711 --> 01:44:38.946
It's coming!

01:44:40.747 --> 01:44:42.316
What's this?
I don't get it!

01:44:42.583 --> 01:44:43.851
Like we get anything you say!

01:44:43.984 --> 01:44:46.220
When our planes land
for the first time

01:44:46.353 --> 01:44:49.389
it would be auspicious
to land facing east!

01:44:49.523 --> 01:44:51.525
You won't get it!
Back off!

01:44:51.658 --> 01:44:55.529
No! They'll land
only as per the designated coordinates!

01:44:55.662 --> 01:44:56.997
There you go again!

01:44:57.097 --> 01:44:58.932
Never clear!

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.467
That's ours, right?

01:45:00.767 --> 01:45:02.870
Look, uncle!
Our plane's coming!

01:45:03.437 --> 01:45:05.339
Chennai Tower, this is Deccan Air 582.

01:45:05.405 --> 01:45:07.441
Minimum fuel.
Requesting landing clearance.

01:45:07.508 --> 01:45:09.776
Go around, Deccan Air 582.

01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:12.579
Where are the other two planes?

01:45:12.713 --> 01:45:15.282
Is that why you brought three garlands?
Others will be here in two days.

01:45:17.718 --> 01:45:19.253
Why aren't they landing?

01:45:19.386 --> 01:45:20.754
They are not getting permission to land?

01:45:20.888 --> 01:45:22.789
Is there a problem with
DA-582's landing?

01:45:22.923 --> 01:45:25.425
It's huge!
Garlands are small, damn!

01:45:25.592 --> 01:45:27.027
How long will they circle around?

01:45:27.127 --> 01:45:28.962
Get to the ATC, boys!
I'll handle the ground operation!

01:45:29.029 --> 01:45:30.430
-Seby, come with me.
-Go!

01:45:30.898 --> 01:45:32.633
-I need to go too, uncle!
-Where are you going?

01:45:32.766 --> 01:45:34.801
-Let go! Why is he running?
-Don't run!

01:45:34.935 --> 01:45:36.870
I said we have a fuel emergency,
goddammit!

01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:39.973
I say again.
Deccan Air 582. Go around.

01:45:40.107 --> 01:45:42.342
There is something's wrong, Captain.
They're ignoring protocol.

01:45:42.409 --> 01:45:44.144
Chennai Tower,
requesting reason for denial!

01:45:44.478 --> 01:45:47.915
I say this again.
Go around, Deccan Air 582!

01:45:48.749 --> 01:45:49.416
Paresh.

01:45:49.883 --> 01:45:51.051
This is highly risky.

01:45:51.151 --> 01:45:53.487
If we delay any further,
the plane is going to crash.

01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.389
You said you just wanted to scare them!

01:45:55.489 --> 01:45:58.258
You're using civil aviation property!

01:45:58.392 --> 01:46:00.627
I'll be the one investigated!

01:46:00.761 --> 01:46:01.495
How dare you?

01:46:04.131 --> 01:46:07.000
You are not dumb enough

01:46:07.067 --> 01:46:10.437
to piss off the man who put you
in the DGCA.

01:46:10.504 --> 01:46:11.171
Right?

01:46:12.773 --> 01:46:14.241
You owe me, my friend!

01:46:14.474 --> 01:46:17.678
Paresh, we'll be in trouble,
if this flight crashes.

01:46:18.946 --> 01:46:19.680
Che!

01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:21.348
Tambaram Air Force.
Runway 1-5.

01:46:21.481 --> 01:46:23.617
Land there!
Do you have enough fuel for that?

01:46:23.684 --> 01:46:24.651
I'll take care of it.

01:46:24.785 --> 01:46:25.853
Switch to company frequency!

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.921
Who do you think you are?

01:46:28.422 --> 01:46:29.590
I own that fucking plane!

01:46:31.725 --> 01:46:33.227
Guards, take him out.

01:46:34.127 --> 01:46:35.762
Security breach at gate one!

01:46:35.863 --> 01:46:38.599
Che, listen, if the fuel is low,
switch to auxiliary engines!

01:46:38.699 --> 01:46:41.268
Don't teach me how to do my job!

01:46:41.368 --> 01:46:45.339
My dad warned me not to hang out with you.
I should've listened!

01:46:45.639 --> 01:46:47.641
Anything happens to me,
tell Preethi I love her.

01:46:47.774 --> 01:46:50.444
I'll tell that Brigadier's daughter, too!

01:46:51.044 --> 01:46:52.646
Get our plane home safe, man!

01:47:00.587 --> 01:47:01.255
Che!

01:47:08.395 --> 01:47:09.396
Come in, Che!

01:47:10.697 --> 01:47:11.365
Che!

01:47:12.232 --> 01:47:12.900
Get help!

01:47:14.034 --> 01:47:16.803
-Open the emergency hatch! Hurry!
-He's fine, right?

01:47:20.874 --> 01:47:23.310
We are ex Air Force!
There are two pilots inside!

01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:24.811
They need some help!

01:47:26.647 --> 01:47:27.481
Batch of '87!

01:47:28.315 --> 01:47:29.216
We need some help!

01:47:30.484 --> 01:47:32.386
Two pilots are trapped inside!
Please help them.

01:47:32.519 --> 01:47:34.688
Please help them!
It's an emergency!

01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:44.598
Che!

01:47:45.132 --> 01:47:45.933
Are you okay?

01:47:46.366 --> 01:47:47.034
Are you okay?

01:47:56.577 --> 01:47:57.244
Jai Hind, sir!

01:48:12.626 --> 01:48:15.696
Why didn't you declare Mayday
and land at the Airport?

01:48:15.796 --> 01:48:20.534
If we had, they would've impounded
my flights for months!

01:48:20.634 --> 01:48:23.003
My launch is on August 25th.
And it must happen!

01:48:23.303 --> 01:48:24.238
Excuse me, sir.

01:48:24.538 --> 01:48:26.039
Jai Hind, sir.
Call for you, sir.

01:48:26.139 --> 01:48:29.042
The airport authorities want an update
for the press!

01:48:38.418 --> 01:48:41.822
Three years ago, a Saudia Air Boeing
made an emergency landing.

01:48:42.389 --> 01:48:44.157
On this very airstrip!

01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:45.959
-Remember, Chaitanya?
-Sir.

01:48:46.827 --> 01:48:48.228
What did we do?

01:48:48.328 --> 01:48:50.464
We investigated for terrorist links.

01:48:50.998 --> 01:48:52.499
And then we levied a five crore fine.

01:48:53.066 --> 01:48:56.270
You three will get a ten-year prison term
along with the fine.

01:49:02.809 --> 01:49:04.711
You haven't even taken off

01:49:05.812 --> 01:49:08.115
and you already have enemies
all the way to Delhi!

01:49:11.018 --> 01:49:11.718
We're done here.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.089
They aren't terrorists!

01:49:16.623 --> 01:49:18.292
Tell them
I'm letting them go!

01:49:18.825 --> 01:49:19.860
They'll pay a fine!

01:49:20.661 --> 01:49:22.196
-Dismiss!
-Jai Hind, sir!

01:49:24.298 --> 01:49:25.532
You will pay a fine!

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:28.268
For the unauthorized landing
at our base

01:49:28.602 --> 01:49:29.469
it's 25,000!

01:49:31.038 --> 01:49:33.440
You can pay three months after
you start your airline.

01:49:37.177 --> 01:49:38.378
What are you waiting for?

01:49:38.512 --> 01:49:40.414
A hug and a sendoff ceremony?

01:49:40.948 --> 01:49:41.615
Go.

01:49:42.716 --> 01:49:43.951
-Out!
-Sir!

01:49:48.856 --> 01:49:51.525
They'll target you for letting me go.

01:49:53.193 --> 01:49:55.028
Do I look scared?

01:49:55.128 --> 01:49:57.631
You've never liked me, sir.

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.834
Maha!

01:50:01.969 --> 01:50:03.670
If I had not punished you
back then

01:50:04.471 --> 01:50:09.476
my cadets wouldn't have respected me.

01:50:09.576 --> 01:50:11.712
And if I bow to political pressure now

01:50:11.845 --> 01:50:13.614
I won't respect myself.

01:50:13.914 --> 01:50:14.681
Brother...

01:50:15.516 --> 01:50:17.484
What you intend to do

01:50:18.485 --> 01:50:22.756
is much bigger
than either of our egos.

01:50:24.558 --> 01:50:29.129
A soldier must ensure
to bring every trooper home.

01:50:29.696 --> 01:50:30.998
Like you did today.

01:50:32.065 --> 01:50:33.133
You are a leader today.

01:50:34.535 --> 01:50:35.769
Leader.

01:50:41.175 --> 01:50:42.109
I don't smoke.

01:50:43.343 --> 01:50:45.579
You shouldn't either.
You're getting old, right?

01:50:45.879 --> 01:50:46.547
Hey!

01:50:47.447 --> 01:50:49.149
Don't you dare call me old!

01:50:50.284 --> 01:50:52.953
Get out before I change my mind.

01:50:53.787 --> 01:50:54.755
Get lost!

01:50:55.656 --> 01:50:56.323
Thank you, sir.

01:51:07.935 --> 01:51:10.470
Mr. Mahesh!
Ready to fly, huh?

01:51:12.306 --> 01:51:14.741
Are you inviting the minister?
Good, good!

01:51:16.076 --> 01:51:17.744
Need a recommendation?

01:51:20.881 --> 01:51:23.150
Do you know Tata?
Ratan Tata?

01:51:25.152 --> 01:51:27.721
He himself couldn't start an airline here.

01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:31.558
Poor guy tried for 20 years!

01:51:31.959 --> 01:51:33.660
-Twenty years...
-You think you can scare me?

01:51:34.428 --> 01:51:36.496
Going on and on
about Ratan Tata!

01:51:36.997 --> 01:51:37.698
I'm not Ratan Tata!

01:51:37.965 --> 01:51:38.632
You bloody...

01:51:38.999 --> 01:51:40.400
People trust me.
That will do.

01:51:41.034 --> 01:51:41.735
Ah, the crowds!

01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:43.570
Public opinion?

01:51:44.571 --> 01:51:46.206
That changes every week!

01:51:47.074 --> 01:51:49.576
Be careful, Mr. Mahesh.

01:51:50.577 --> 01:51:51.245
Excuse me.

01:51:52.346 --> 01:51:53.680
I have an airline to run, my friend.

01:51:54.681 --> 01:51:56.483
It's my time now!

01:52:01.622 --> 01:52:02.823
The people are with him.

01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:05.759
You keep swatting at that bee,
but it keeps flying.

01:52:07.494 --> 01:52:08.161
Murthy?

01:52:09.496 --> 01:52:10.898
-Murthy!
-Sir.

01:52:11.465 --> 01:52:12.165
It's Mallesham, sir.

01:52:12.699 --> 01:52:13.800
Right, Mallesham!

01:52:14.768 --> 01:52:15.569
Mallesham...

01:52:16.703 --> 01:52:18.705
Do you know Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam?

01:52:19.773 --> 01:52:20.440
I do, sir.

01:52:21.375 --> 01:52:22.075
What do you know?

01:52:22.776 --> 01:52:25.179
I heard he's offering
plane tickets at low price.

01:52:25.712 --> 01:52:27.548
You'll make people fly
for just one rupee?

01:52:28.015 --> 01:52:28.782
Impossible!

01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:31.151
Today, 75% of flights fly half-empty!

01:52:31.285 --> 01:52:32.920
I'll charge a rupee
for each empty seat.

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.356
Just a rupee for those who book
much in advance.

01:52:37.124 --> 01:52:39.660
Once those are booked,
500 rupee seats open up!

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.028
Then, the 1,000s!

01:52:41.161 --> 01:52:44.531
But aren't you deceiving people
by giving just ten one rupee tickets?

01:52:44.665 --> 01:52:47.234
Three planes.
Ten trips each per day.

01:52:47.367 --> 01:52:50.504
That is 300 people will fly at one rupee,
per day.

01:52:50.704 --> 01:52:53.674
And even our most expensive ticket
costs the same as an A/C train ticket.

01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:55.442
Will you fly in that plane?

01:52:55.909 --> 01:52:57.344
I don't know if I will, sir.

01:52:58.212 --> 01:53:02.182
But I want my mother to fly
at least once.

01:53:03.383 --> 01:53:04.952
She'll be very happy.

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.889
There are two unused airstrips
in your region.

01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:13.427
Imagine the impact
when these planes land there!

01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:19.833
So my servant will fly with me
as an equal?

01:53:19.933 --> 01:53:21.568
And I'm supposed to let that happen?

01:53:21.702 --> 01:53:23.003
His investment.

01:53:24.004 --> 01:53:25.339
That must be destroyed first.

01:53:25.439 --> 01:53:28.242
We're proud to cover
the launch of this airline

01:53:28.375 --> 01:53:32.012
that could be a significant milestone
in the history of Indian aviation!

01:53:32.079 --> 01:53:36.083
Even a cup of tea costs more than a rupee.
But Maha's making people fly for a rupee!

01:53:36.216 --> 01:53:39.419
I hereby announce two airstrips
will be operated in my region alone!

01:53:39.553 --> 01:53:43.857
I've always been a visionary.
We must encourage the youth of our nation.

01:53:43.957 --> 01:53:45.926
I hereby declare Deccan Air launched!

01:53:53.567 --> 01:53:55.035
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

01:53:55.135 --> 01:53:57.538
you're welcome onboard,
Deccan Air maiden flight.

01:54:00.941 --> 01:54:03.477
We're now ready for departure.
Enjoy our services. Thank you.

01:54:25.332 --> 01:54:27.267
Deccan Air 582
ready for departure.

01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:29.837
Line up and clear for take-off.
Wind calm.

01:54:47.287 --> 01:54:48.789
-Fire! Get up!
-Go! Go!

01:54:51.258 --> 01:54:53.093
Please sit!

01:54:59.633 --> 01:55:01.034
What's going on?
Look!

01:55:01.902 --> 01:55:03.403
Please sit down!

01:55:05.472 --> 01:55:06.807
There's smoke in engine one!

01:55:07.074 --> 01:55:08.675
Stay calm!

01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:11.278
Mahesh, where are you going?

01:55:11.979 --> 01:55:13.347
Please stay calm!

01:55:13.447 --> 01:55:14.314
Captain!

01:55:14.948 --> 01:55:15.983
Captain, smoke.

01:55:17.251 --> 01:55:18.252
Captain, smoke.

01:55:18.852 --> 01:55:20.020
Captain, smoke.!
Abort!

01:55:20.354 --> 01:55:21.622
Captain! Captain!

01:55:22.055 --> 01:55:24.691
Reject take-off!
Power lever idle! Shut down engines!

01:55:27.961 --> 01:55:29.663
Captain, come on!
Apply brakes, Captain!

01:55:35.035 --> 01:55:36.537
Applying maximum brakes!

01:55:58.358 --> 01:56:01.762
Deccan Air 582 to Chennai Tower!
Mayday, Mayday! Engine is smoking!

01:56:01.895 --> 01:56:03.864
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!

01:56:04.198 --> 01:56:07.067
Evacuate! Go! Go!

01:56:09.903 --> 01:56:10.904
Come along, sir!

01:56:11.004 --> 01:56:12.239
Mahesh, what is this?

01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.708
Steer clear of the aircraft!

01:56:14.842 --> 01:56:16.710
Stay back!
Move away! Sir!

01:56:19.746 --> 01:56:22.182
Relax, sir. Please wait in the lounge.
I'll set things right.

01:56:22.316 --> 01:56:23.550
How much longer, Che?

01:56:23.684 --> 01:56:25.385
Forty five minutes!
Just give me some time.

01:56:25.619 --> 01:56:27.020
Sir, relax. Nothing to panic, sir.

01:56:27.387 --> 01:56:29.056
This is a failure, man!
Drive!

01:56:29.289 --> 01:56:31.725
-Sir! Please don't say that!
-Drive!

01:56:32.326 --> 01:56:34.294
Sir!
Please, sir!

01:56:38.532 --> 01:56:40.968
His problem is he aims too high!

01:56:41.235 --> 01:56:44.738
Rush into things, and this happens!
You put our village to shame!

01:56:44.872 --> 01:56:47.608
-Shut up, dad!
-You shut up!

01:56:57.518 --> 01:56:58.819
Guys! Guys!
Mahesh is here.

01:56:59.119 --> 01:56:59.887
Come on, come on.

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.390
Mr. Mahesh, is it true
you disregarded safety regulations?

01:57:03.490 --> 01:57:04.491
Answer us!

01:57:04.625 --> 01:57:06.426
Your very first trip ended in disaster!

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.128
Your cheap tickets
will claim lives!

01:57:08.262 --> 01:57:09.162
It was not intentional!

01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:12.165
-Did you not follow safety regulations?
-We have!

01:57:12.299 --> 01:57:15.669
Answer us, sir!
People deserve the truth!

01:57:15.802 --> 01:57:18.906
-Why have you gone silent?
-Answer us!

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.241
Speak up!

01:57:21.341 --> 01:57:24.912
Is human life worth so little to you?

01:57:27.281 --> 01:57:29.283
Is a life worth so little?

01:57:29.483 --> 01:57:30.317
I'm explaining that.

01:57:46.466 --> 01:57:48.101
I'll handle this!

01:57:48.202 --> 01:57:49.203
You handle them!

01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:50.971
Let's go, uncle!

01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:55.542
Come along, uncle!

01:57:55.676 --> 01:57:56.610
We can go.

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.356
Is it true you did not follow
safety regulations? Answer us!

01:58:09.723 --> 01:58:13.694
As per international regulations,
we did safety checks in India and France!

01:58:14.294 --> 01:58:17.197
Our goal was low-priced airlines.
Not undermining security.

01:58:17.331 --> 01:58:20.701
India has so many basic issues!
Is flying a necessity?

01:58:20.834 --> 01:58:23.136
Every benefit must reach everyone!
And they will!

01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:26.273
This is my domain.
And I want to break the barriers here!

01:58:26.373 --> 01:58:27.107
Is it wrong?

01:58:27.241 --> 01:58:28.976
Such philosophies only sound good.

01:58:29.042 --> 01:58:31.345
I am telling you!
Hear me out!

01:58:31.478 --> 01:58:34.648
We did all due diligence!
No rules were violated!

01:58:39.119 --> 01:58:41.555
People are not about to get into
one of these flights in a hurry.

01:58:41.889 --> 01:58:47.427
People will not fly Deccan Air again.
This may well be their last flight.

01:59:27.935 --> 01:59:29.469
The teacher is back!

02:00:03.437 --> 02:00:06.139
Are we contesting elections?
Good enough if people fly.

02:00:07.841 --> 02:00:09.076
So shall we issue a CRS?

02:00:10.978 --> 02:00:12.346
Yeah. Go check!

02:00:14.448 --> 02:00:16.149
Has the oil been uplifted, Che?

02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:20.087
They've assigned Bay 64 to us.

02:00:26.693 --> 02:00:27.761
Mr. Rajiv Manohar,

02:00:28.495 --> 02:00:31.365
your statement says that
Deccan Air violated many safety rules.

02:00:31.732 --> 02:00:32.799
Can you elaborate?

02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.003
What crimes did Deccan Air commit?
Tell us.

02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:39.606
Is it true that Deccan Air
was indifferent?

02:00:44.945 --> 02:00:45.612
No, sir.

02:00:46.813 --> 02:00:48.248
This is all my fault.

02:00:50.184 --> 02:00:53.020
What's this, sir?
He keeps changing his statement!

02:00:53.153 --> 02:00:56.557
Did someone force you
to sabotage Deccan Air's flight?

02:00:57.024 --> 02:01:00.561
I was negligent during fueling.

02:01:00.694 --> 02:01:02.596
I didn't do my safety checks properly.

02:01:02.996 --> 02:01:04.364
It's my fault.

02:01:05.065 --> 02:01:06.333
Is someone threatening you?

02:01:06.633 --> 02:01:09.036
We all know who is threatening whom.

02:01:10.304 --> 02:01:12.406
Explain that, Mr. Manohar.

02:01:12.906 --> 02:01:13.974
Who is threatening you?

02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:15.309
Let it go.

02:01:16.476 --> 02:01:18.846
I'm satisfied with his statement.
It's okay.

02:01:19.246 --> 02:01:21.248
Deccan Air's not at fault.

02:01:21.515 --> 02:01:23.083
File the report as 'Pilot Negligence'.

02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:25.352
It was not a technical failure.

02:01:25.485 --> 02:01:27.421
Deccan Air is cleared of all charges.

02:01:34.828 --> 02:01:35.896
I trusted you, Captain.

02:01:36.864 --> 02:01:41.034
I have many problems at home.

02:01:41.201 --> 02:01:41.869
Worse than mine?

02:01:44.238 --> 02:01:46.039
They'll try to buy us, sir.

02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.709
Saying no is our only strength!

02:01:48.842 --> 02:01:49.643
But I...

02:01:50.644 --> 02:01:52.079
I won't ask you to leave.

02:01:56.617 --> 02:01:58.719
What are you doing, Maha?
Why did you let him off?

02:01:59.653 --> 02:02:00.754
He's my father's age, Che.

02:02:05.726 --> 02:02:10.030
Monday 9 pm, an exclusive interview
with Paresh Goswami!

02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:10.964
-Live!
-Maha?

02:02:11.465 --> 02:02:13.600
Why won't you pick up the phone
or charge the damn thing?

02:02:14.201 --> 02:02:17.070
Balaiyya PA trying to contact you.
They want to meet you tomorrow!

02:02:18.071 --> 02:02:18.872
I'm not going.

02:02:19.239 --> 02:02:20.874
It could be useful to us.

02:02:21.708 --> 02:02:23.210
I don't want his help!

02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:25.612
The shape we're in,
we need all the help we can get!

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.815
I'll not deal with his kind anymore.

02:02:31.818 --> 02:02:33.554
I'm taking the evening bus home.

02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:36.657
You just got here this morning.

02:02:37.124 --> 02:02:38.225
Stay here for a couple of days.

02:02:39.092 --> 02:02:41.395
No, buddy,
I just came by to see you.

02:02:42.396 --> 02:02:45.899
My sister's fiance's family
is asking for a wedding date.

02:02:47.067 --> 02:02:49.636
Don't stress.
Whenever you say!

02:02:49.770 --> 02:02:53.073
Just indicate a date,
and I'll manage the rest.

02:02:54.107 --> 02:02:55.509
See you.
Bye, Baby!

02:02:55.642 --> 02:02:56.643
Let's go, Raja.

02:03:02.349 --> 02:03:04.318
Not one interview of yours
is here.

02:03:04.451 --> 02:03:08.889
The future of Deccan Air
remains a question mark.

02:03:09.923 --> 02:03:13.026
Running an airline is not a game!
No wonder it tanked!

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.363
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

02:03:16.496 --> 02:03:20.701
Paresh Goswami questions
if the DGCA enquiry commission was bribed.

02:03:20.834 --> 02:03:22.636
Even our advertisement's been buried!

02:03:22.769 --> 02:03:25.205
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

02:03:26.106 --> 02:03:29.443
Due to safety issues,
Deccan Air has come to an end.

02:03:32.713 --> 02:03:34.615
They broke people's faith in us.

02:04:07.648 --> 02:04:09.249
A plane, Maha!
Come on, race!

02:04:10.584 --> 02:04:11.418
Maha?

02:04:15.255 --> 02:04:17.424
Welcome, welcome.
Come have a drink.

02:04:17.491 --> 02:04:18.158
No, we're good.

02:04:18.292 --> 02:04:20.327
Go ahead, have a drink, man.
Have fun!

02:04:20.394 --> 02:04:23.530
-Why did you call?
-Alright, I'll get to the point.

02:04:23.664 --> 02:04:24.898
Why do we need two airlines?

02:04:25.032 --> 02:04:28.769
I'll merge your company with mine.

02:04:28.936 --> 02:04:30.370
Who will fly in our planes then?

02:04:30.504 --> 02:04:32.105
Of course, only the rich!

02:04:32.239 --> 02:04:35.008
My team said a maximum of 12 crores.

02:04:35.108 --> 02:04:37.244
But I'll give you 15!

02:04:38.579 --> 02:04:40.414
Guys! Do we have a deal?

02:04:42.015 --> 02:04:44.017
Okay. Sixteen crores, then!

02:04:46.987 --> 02:04:50.958
Mahesh, you better take it
before I change my mind.

02:04:51.091 --> 02:04:53.260
Sir, give us two minutes.
We'll discuss and get back to you.

02:04:54.127 --> 02:04:54.828
Okay.

02:04:55.362 --> 02:04:57.531
Let's think it over, Maha.

02:04:57.631 --> 02:04:58.532
I already have.

02:04:59.266 --> 02:04:59.933
No.

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:01.735
Why are you taking a risk?

02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:03.437
It's a great offer.
Take it, man!

02:05:06.073 --> 02:05:08.475
Sometimes, I get doubts
about my airline's success.

02:05:09.543 --> 02:05:11.478
But the way you're lusting after it

02:05:12.713 --> 02:05:13.814
my doubts are all gone.

02:05:13.947 --> 02:05:16.683
Come on. You've no business sense.

02:05:17.217 --> 02:05:20.687
You can't survive a day here
without my support.

02:05:20.954 --> 02:05:22.523
I don't get you, man!

02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:24.157
You won't.

02:05:24.925 --> 02:05:26.693
You're a socialite.
I'm a socialist.

02:05:27.628 --> 02:05:29.997
We are nothing alike.

02:05:30.664 --> 02:05:31.565
Imbecile!

02:05:31.899 --> 02:05:32.666
Let's go!

02:05:33.734 --> 02:05:35.435
-Did he call me an imbecile?
-Yes, sir.

02:05:36.937 --> 02:05:39.106
How can you decide alone?

02:05:39.239 --> 02:05:40.941
Don't you need to discuss it with us?

02:05:41.074 --> 02:05:42.910
I quit my job because of you!

02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:44.111
Is that nothing to you?

02:05:45.078 --> 02:05:46.313
You call this a partnership?

02:05:48.282 --> 02:05:49.550
You'll bring us to the streets?

02:05:50.017 --> 02:05:51.018
What's your problem?

02:05:51.919 --> 02:05:52.619
Tell me!

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:54.454
You're crazy!

02:05:54.588 --> 02:05:56.456
Think about us too.
We all are in deep shit.

02:05:56.590 --> 02:06:00.294
Seby has a family to feed!
My dad cut me off when I quit my job!

02:06:00.427 --> 02:06:01.662
Aren't we human beings too!

02:06:01.862 --> 02:06:04.631
Who can stick with you?
Is your wife happy at least?

02:06:04.965 --> 02:06:06.333
-Hey.
-Hey, hey!

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.434
What are you doing?

02:06:08.769 --> 02:06:09.770
Go on, hit me!

02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:12.139
Don't hit the bellies of the villagers
relying on you!

02:06:12.272 --> 02:06:14.875
Am I? That dog inside doesn't get it!
Don't you, too?

02:06:15.008 --> 02:06:17.845
By turning him down,
we make a billion Indians fly one day!

02:06:17.978 --> 02:06:19.513
Why are we here?

02:06:19.646 --> 02:06:21.348
Do you get
what is he asking us to sell?

02:06:22.716 --> 02:06:24.718
Our dream.
Don't you get that?

02:07:12.666 --> 02:07:13.901
How much did he offer?

02:07:15.335 --> 02:07:16.436
Sixteen crores.

02:07:17.504 --> 02:07:18.505
Did you take it?

02:07:31.552 --> 02:07:33.253
I let down our family, Baby.

02:07:35.055 --> 02:07:36.023
Did you poison the food?

02:07:37.224 --> 02:07:38.759
I would have, if you sold out.

02:07:51.471 --> 02:07:53.640
This is a small show
on All India Radio.

02:07:53.774 --> 02:07:55.909
It will do, ma'am.
It's the language of my people.

02:07:56.043 --> 02:07:58.245
I'll talk to the new FM stations.

02:07:58.378 --> 02:08:00.247
They're growing.
You'll get a wider reach.

02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:03.917
Ready?

02:08:04.585 --> 02:08:08.989
Five, four, three, two, one.

02:08:09.656 --> 02:08:10.324
Go!

02:08:10.991 --> 02:08:11.692
Sir?

02:08:13.627 --> 02:08:15.529
We look at the skies
with awe,

02:08:15.963 --> 02:08:18.065
but wouldn't dare dream
of seeing the world from up there.

02:08:18.398 --> 02:08:19.166
Same thing back home.

02:08:19.299 --> 02:08:22.970
But today, we've risen too
and come to fly.

02:08:23.637 --> 02:08:26.340
Goswami's afraid of sub-standard people
entering the industry.

02:08:27.241 --> 02:08:28.642
Yes.
He is terrified of us.

02:08:28.842 --> 02:08:31.311
But, not for the reasons he claims.

02:08:31.778 --> 02:08:35.249
He knows well that our airline
passed every safety test like his.

02:08:36.049 --> 02:08:37.017
So, what does he fear?

02:08:37.251 --> 02:08:40.287
He fears that those beneath him
will rise to his level.

02:08:41.288 --> 02:08:44.024
The rich want the poor to remain poor.

02:08:45.492 --> 02:08:47.528
A century ago, they claimed
electricity was only for them.

02:08:48.161 --> 02:08:49.997
Fifty years ago,
they said that about cars.

02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:51.131
Who are they to decide?

02:08:51.865 --> 02:08:54.101
No one except them
should enjoy it all, right?

02:08:55.135 --> 02:08:59.173
We spend days
to go from place to place.

02:08:59.773 --> 02:09:00.941
But the rich?

02:09:01.041 --> 02:09:02.943
They fly like Gods above us!

02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:06.013
If we level with them,
no one will be beneath them.

02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.314
That's what he fears!

02:09:07.447 --> 02:09:10.551
You can now book plane tickets
over the phone.

02:09:10.784 --> 02:09:12.386
We will give you a PNR number.

02:09:12.519 --> 02:09:16.857
Just show the number
at your bank or post office.

02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:18.959
Why do small towns remain small?

02:09:19.326 --> 02:09:20.160
Why haven't they grown?

02:09:20.661 --> 02:09:22.796
To grow,
sometimes we must walk

02:09:23.297 --> 02:09:24.565
sometimes, we must run

02:09:24.698 --> 02:09:26.233
and sometimes, we have to fly!

02:09:26.533 --> 02:09:28.535
That is called as air connectivity.

02:09:29.136 --> 02:09:31.405
My airline promises
air connectivity to everyone.

02:09:32.206 --> 02:09:33.941
Our planes will reach
every small town!

02:09:34.541 --> 02:09:36.677
And every place will grow!

02:09:37.511 --> 02:09:41.181
Won't that scare the privileged?

02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:45.752
The Question with Amit Trivedi.

02:09:45.953 --> 02:09:48.255
-Thank you for joining us on The Question.
-Thank you.

02:09:48.655 --> 02:09:52.259
Let's talk about what's on
everyone's mind: Low cost aviation.

02:09:52.492 --> 02:09:53.694
Your thoughts, sir?

02:09:54.428 --> 02:09:55.329
Look, Mr. Amit.

02:09:56.663 --> 02:10:02.135
When flying in an aluminum can
at 1,000 km/hr,

02:10:02.436 --> 02:10:03.937
what will be on your mind?

02:10:04.204 --> 02:10:05.806
-Safety.
-Exactly!

02:10:06.406 --> 02:10:09.910
That safety requires
all kinds of testing and security!

02:10:10.410 --> 02:10:13.647
It's expensive,
but is a must!

02:10:14.081 --> 02:10:18.519
When someone offers to lower that price,
people must think hard.

02:10:18.619 --> 02:10:19.953
They have a point, sir.

02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:22.422
How can one feel safe
at such low prices?

02:10:22.556 --> 02:10:25.192
I have a question
for Goswami on safety.

02:10:25.526 --> 02:10:28.562
His first class tickets
cost three times more than economy.

02:10:28.929 --> 02:10:30.397
Should there be an accident

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:33.967
would he guarantee thrice the safety
to first class passengers?

02:10:34.101 --> 02:10:35.602
But I will guarantee you this.

02:10:36.904 --> 02:10:40.107
The Deccan Air pilots
flew fighter jets for India.

02:10:40.908 --> 02:10:43.243
Who can fly you safer than them?

02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:48.448
Here's why we are afraid
of Chandra Mahesh entering our business.

02:10:48.582 --> 02:10:51.618
Shoddy equipment.

02:10:51.752 --> 02:10:53.620
Retired pilots.

02:10:54.054 --> 02:10:55.722
Sub-standard products.

02:10:55.789 --> 02:10:58.759
He brings in many dangers.

02:10:59.626 --> 02:11:02.496
The enquiry commission
cleared us of all charges.

02:11:03.130 --> 02:11:06.266
I have no money
to bribe them.

02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.471
I won't pay bribes
with my people's hard earned money.

02:11:12.673 --> 02:11:15.576
If money was my priority,
I'd have made millions ages ago!

02:11:15.676 --> 02:11:17.978
Or I'd gladly tend to my home
and child.

02:11:18.111 --> 02:11:19.913
Because my wife's very successful.

02:11:20.914 --> 02:11:22.783
You talk of so many obstacles.

02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:24.585
Why do you go on?

02:11:25.752 --> 02:11:28.856
My father wanted electricity
in our village. We got it.

02:11:28.989 --> 02:11:30.657
He wanted a train for us.
We got it.

02:11:30.791 --> 02:11:33.160
I want the benefits of modern science
to reach everyone.

02:11:33.293 --> 02:11:36.496
I want to break the cost barrier
and the damn caste barrier too!

02:11:36.630 --> 02:11:38.665
That's why our tickets
cost one rupee.

02:11:38.932 --> 02:11:40.300
With quality and safety.

02:11:40.601 --> 02:11:43.670
When flying on a legacy airline
like Jaz

02:11:44.037 --> 02:11:46.773
you're completely assured
of safety.

02:11:47.107 --> 02:11:51.144
As we have a well-trained crew
and the best infrastructure

02:11:51.211 --> 02:11:53.413
our ticket prices
will be higher!

02:11:54.147 --> 02:11:55.349
But...

02:11:55.482 --> 02:12:00.287
Mahesh's stripping away all this
and offering dirt cheap tickets!

02:12:00.387 --> 02:12:01.388
Tell me,

02:12:01.522 --> 02:12:04.191
is your life worth
the same as a cup of tea?

02:12:06.226 --> 02:12:07.594
My flights are safe.

02:12:08.562 --> 02:12:11.198
All I'll say to those who don't trust
our safety report is this.

02:12:11.331 --> 02:12:13.233
This is my own safety test!

02:12:13.367 --> 02:12:16.670
The three people I love the most
will be on Deccan's first flights.

02:12:18.805 --> 02:12:19.806
My mother Parvathi.

02:12:22.309 --> 02:12:23.410
My wife Sundari.

02:12:26.079 --> 02:12:27.214
My daughter Ammu.

02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:32.886
Giving airlines to such people

02:12:33.253 --> 02:12:36.690
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill!

02:12:37.024 --> 02:12:40.561
This must be nipped in the bud!
It's a scary prospect!

02:12:40.694 --> 02:12:43.830
Listen to him some more
and even I'll believe him!

02:12:43.997 --> 02:12:46.099
Do you have any proof
for those acquisitions?

02:12:47.034 --> 02:12:48.602
Maha! Maha!

02:12:49.236 --> 02:12:49.937
-Maha!
-Maha!

02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:50.938
Maha, hold on!

02:12:51.038 --> 02:12:53.507
We've been trying to reach you!
What happened?

02:12:54.641 --> 02:12:56.410
My cell battery's also dead, I guess.

02:12:56.844 --> 02:12:59.513
You've not slept in three days.
You'll go crazy this way.

02:13:00.013 --> 02:13:01.548
How can I sleep?

02:13:02.115 --> 02:13:05.352
He could do anything to our planes.
We need to guard them.

02:13:06.019 --> 02:13:06.687
Maha!

02:13:24.271 --> 02:13:25.339
What's up, Chandra Mahesh?

02:13:26.573 --> 02:13:28.542
Only Goswami has friends or what?

02:13:28.942 --> 02:13:30.711
Don't we have friends?

02:13:31.411 --> 02:13:33.280
We never let down our comrades!

02:13:34.915 --> 02:13:36.083
Go and take rest, man!

02:13:36.783 --> 02:13:38.519
I have this covered!

02:13:40.087 --> 02:13:41.522
Get into position, boys!

02:13:44.157 --> 02:13:44.825
Sir.

02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.702
Take care of the wing tip clearance,
Mohan!

02:13:57.070 --> 02:13:58.472
All in position at Bay 63?

02:13:58.705 --> 02:14:01.008
...traveling flight DA 581,

02:14:01.542 --> 02:14:03.310
please proceed to gate number two.

02:14:32.806 --> 02:14:34.908
-Are we ready for boarding?
-Yes, Captain.

02:14:34.975 --> 02:14:35.709
Okay.

02:14:35.976 --> 02:14:37.344
Luggage tractors can go there,
right?

02:14:42.449 --> 02:14:44.117
Welcome, Captain.
Welcome.

02:14:56.730 --> 02:14:57.631
Just a minute, Raghava.

02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:12.980
It's faster to get to my hometown by bus!

02:15:14.114 --> 02:15:16.250
Why is only our plane parked so far away?

02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:19.052
No matter where they throw us,
we will fly.

02:15:24.558 --> 02:15:26.493
-Go on.
-Good day, ma'am. Sir.

02:15:29.496 --> 02:15:31.632
We're really happy
to have you on board, ma'am.

02:15:32.232 --> 02:15:34.768
-There are no passengers?
-There's still time, ma'am.

02:15:37.771 --> 02:15:39.106
They'll come, won't they?

02:15:40.574 --> 02:15:41.241
They will.

02:15:44.745 --> 02:15:46.713
This is the last and final call

02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.749
for passengers traveling
from Chennai to Thoothukudi

02:15:48.882 --> 02:15:54.288
on flight DA-581,
which is set to take off in a few minutes.

02:15:54.354 --> 02:15:56.990
I repeat, this is the last and final call

02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:02.362
for passengers traveling to Thoothukudi
on flight DA 581.

02:16:02.496 --> 02:16:03.730
Cheer up!
We'll handle it!

02:16:10.604 --> 02:16:15.209
It's doubtful if people
will risk their lives and fly Deccan Air.

02:16:32.125 --> 02:16:34.194
People will reject
such an unsafe airline.

02:16:34.261 --> 02:16:36.997
And yes, it does look like the end
for Deccan Air.

02:17:02.456 --> 02:17:04.458
Our flight's been cancelled,
Captain.

02:17:51.071 --> 02:17:52.439
People didn't believe me, Baby.

02:17:55.576 --> 02:17:56.243
Let's go.

02:18:02.649 --> 02:18:05.752
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

02:18:06.353 --> 02:18:10.090
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

02:18:11.792 --> 02:18:14.661
You're out of your league!
Go home and graze your cows!

02:18:16.263 --> 02:18:19.333
Giving airlines to such people

02:18:19.399 --> 02:18:22.536
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill!

02:18:23.003 --> 02:18:26.440
Wow! He remembers their plight!

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:28.942
Thought you forgot
as you were busy reproducing!

02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:31.912
We are all praying for you, my son!

02:18:32.045 --> 02:18:33.213
You should win!

02:18:33.647 --> 02:18:35.449
We are all counting on you.

02:18:37.284 --> 02:18:40.320
He spent just ten minutes
thinking about you

02:18:40.687 --> 02:18:42.389
and you're finished!

02:19:14.688 --> 02:19:15.355
Maha!

02:19:19.193 --> 02:19:21.395
I'm sorry, Maha!
I screwed up!

02:19:21.862 --> 02:19:22.996
You trusted me!

02:19:23.597 --> 02:19:24.965
-Forget it!
-I messed up!

02:19:25.065 --> 02:19:27.301
We tried.
That's what matters.

02:19:27.601 --> 02:19:30.003
We came so close and screwed up!

02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:32.506
I fucked up the Chennai booking!

02:19:35.843 --> 02:19:36.810
What are you saying?

02:19:37.511 --> 02:19:38.312
Be clear!

02:19:38.478 --> 02:19:42.749
The Chennai flight tickets
were not confirmed from our end!

02:19:42.850 --> 02:19:45.919
All bookings in our software
rolled back and got cancelled.

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:49.289
That's why none of our passengers came,
despite booking tickets!

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:53.694
Maha!

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.165
They were unable
to board our flight!

02:20:03.971 --> 02:20:05.305
The problem was in the software!

02:20:06.507 --> 02:20:07.808
People didn't lose faith in us!

02:20:08.742 --> 02:20:10.777
Thousands of our tickets were sold!

02:20:38.372 --> 02:20:39.773
People believed us!

02:20:40.307 --> 02:20:41.708
The other two flights...

02:20:43.076 --> 02:20:44.711
They were fully booked!

02:20:45.412 --> 02:20:47.314
They flew at full capacity!

02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:51.218
We won, Maha!

02:21:04.064 --> 02:21:09.970
Your love brought the skies
Within our grasp

02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:16.710
This will live on
Even when time is gone!

02:21:17.244 --> 02:21:22.950
In the desert in our eyes
We wished for a few raindrops

02:21:23.650 --> 02:21:28.989
Now, with your downpour
Our village smiles lush green

02:21:29.156 --> 02:21:29.823
Super, bro!

02:21:30.090 --> 02:21:35.929
The saplings in the soil
In an attempt to touch the sky

02:21:36.463 --> 02:21:42.069
Suddenly take flight
Soaring towards the stars

02:21:42.836 --> 02:21:48.542
In this scorching summer
As the full moon sheds coolness

02:21:49.276 --> 02:21:53.013
Our hearts feel festive

02:21:53.247 --> 02:21:54.581
Maha, my boy...

02:21:55.482 --> 02:21:59.086
I'm so happy to have flown
in your plane today!

02:21:59.152 --> 02:22:02.289
I've dreamt for years to fly.

02:22:02.456 --> 02:22:04.124
Even my son couldn't
make it happen.

02:22:04.291 --> 02:22:07.661
But today,
with my own savings

02:22:07.828 --> 02:22:11.131
I flew all the way here!
How about that!

02:22:11.298 --> 02:22:13.066
See you, son.

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:14.268
Let's go!

02:22:15.269 --> 02:22:15.936
Buddy!

02:22:16.003 --> 02:22:20.307
Now, with your downpour,
our village smiles lush green!

02:22:27.514 --> 02:22:33.320
As mother fed her little girl
Plate in hand

02:22:34.087 --> 02:22:39.593
She pointed to the faraway moon

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:46.066
Now, thanks to you, the time has come
To ascend a ladder to the sky

02:22:46.266 --> 02:22:47.467
There are no stops

02:22:47.601 --> 02:22:48.836
How was it?

02:22:49.536 --> 02:22:52.105
In the path you tread!

02:22:52.506 --> 02:22:58.478
There are no stops
In the path you tread!

02:23:05.752 --> 02:23:08.755
"Parvathi says he will fly."

02:23:08.989 --> 02:23:13.026
"But I know he won't rest
until he makes everyone fly with him!"

02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:14.361
My darling!

02:23:15.896 --> 02:23:17.364
You did it!

02:23:20.434 --> 02:23:21.702
My dear boy!

02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:24.371
You won!

02:23:25.939 --> 02:23:27.441
Bless you, my boy!

02:23:41.355 --> 02:23:42.155
Hello.

02:23:42.356 --> 02:23:43.190
It's for you.

02:23:43.423 --> 02:23:44.458
Watch what you say.

02:23:44.525 --> 02:23:45.192
Hello?

02:23:45.959 --> 02:23:48.161
Congratulations, Mr. Mahesh!

02:23:48.529 --> 02:23:51.265
Can we meet?
I have a business proposal for you.

02:23:51.398 --> 02:23:54.034
I was expecting your call,
Mr. Goswami.

02:23:54.601 --> 02:23:55.836
Good, good, good.

02:23:56.170 --> 02:23:58.972
I'll have my secretary fix an appointment.
Okay?

02:23:59.806 --> 02:24:01.375
Who are you to give me an appointment?

02:24:02.209 --> 02:24:03.010
What?

02:24:03.544 --> 02:24:05.946
It doesn't matter whether I'm around
or you try to stop me.

02:24:07.214 --> 02:24:10.584
The farmer has flown
and will continue to fly.

02:24:10.684 --> 02:24:12.619
You don't own the sky, you scum.

02:24:12.786 --> 02:24:14.621
-Mr. Mahesh?
-Now fuck off!

02:24:19.092 --> 02:24:23.297
Lay a hand on me if you dare
Silence will resound

02:24:23.497 --> 02:24:27.734
You'll be crushed under the heels
Of a fierce horse!

02:24:36.310 --> 02:24:42.015
Transformed, have my ways of hunting
Lay a hand on me if you dare

02:25:44.578 --> 02:25:45.279
What is it?

02:25:46.346 --> 02:25:49.049
You messing with me, you hag?
What do you want?

02:25:50.884 --> 02:25:52.419
Want to fly for a buck, huh?

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:08.402
Forget the plane, buddy!

02:26:08.535 --> 02:26:10.904
The cakes which they provided!
So damn delicious!

02:26:11.238 --> 02:26:15.142
I'll fly over and over
just for these cakes!

02:26:16.210 --> 02:26:17.277
Hey bunface...

02:26:19.313 --> 02:26:20.113
Whose idea was it?

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.817
Spark the coal
Which lies within your core

02:26:25.152 --> 02:26:26.753
It's such a pleasure to meet up with you!

02:26:27.254 --> 02:26:30.557
Drop the act!
How dare you sabotage the plane I was in.

02:26:30.757 --> 02:26:33.093
Let's see how your planes are gonna fly!

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.761
-Sir, please let me explain!
-Sir, please come out!

02:26:37.831 --> 02:26:42.636
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

02:26:42.769 --> 02:26:47.241
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

02:26:47.407 --> 02:26:51.745
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

02:26:52.446 --> 02:26:53.380
First time flyer?

02:26:53.514 --> 02:26:56.216
Nah! I've flown these things in circles!

02:26:57.584 --> 02:26:58.452
It's okay.

02:27:01.221 --> 02:27:02.489
Yeah, first time.

02:27:03.156 --> 02:27:05.259
Give wings to dreams
That trust in you and soar

02:27:10.364 --> 02:27:14.067
The sky is the limit

02:27:19.072 --> 02:27:22.976
Let this chance not pass you by

02:27:30.384 --> 02:27:33.086
-What do you do?
-I run a grooming establishment.

02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:35.455
-Meaning?
-I cut hair in my village.

02:27:35.622 --> 02:27:36.757
-I see...
-Own business!

02:27:36.823 --> 02:27:39.226
-And you?
-I run a business, too!

02:27:39.359 --> 02:27:40.327
Don't you recognize him?

02:27:40.394 --> 02:27:42.629
He has a huge clothing store
in Bejawada!

02:27:42.829 --> 02:27:45.566
He gave thirty one lakhs
to our fund for Mahesh! A big man!

02:27:45.666 --> 02:27:47.267
There's no difference between us anymore!

02:27:47.768 --> 02:27:50.437
He's broken down all that
and made us fly together!

02:27:54.341 --> 02:27:55.242
Maha...

02:27:56.977 --> 02:27:59.146
Did that girl fly the plane?

02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:06.653
To hell with business class!
Tear it apart!

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:09.356
They paid for it.
They can sit wherever they please!

02:28:09.923 --> 02:28:13.894
Let not your limitations
Draw your boundaries

02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:16.129
Why the hurry to pay me back?

02:28:16.263 --> 02:28:18.465
You'll need more
as you're growing.

02:28:18.532 --> 02:28:19.933
Feel free to ask anytime!

02:28:20.067 --> 02:28:21.969
We should make a film about you
and run it here!

02:28:22.035 --> 02:28:24.004
He thinks this shack
is an IMAX theatre!

02:28:24.338 --> 02:28:27.307
Let's go, Maha.
This guy thinks he's Director Mani Ratnam!

02:28:27.674 --> 02:28:31.778
Write a brand new story
As your life changes today
