00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:29,690
SOME SCENES IN THE STORY TAKE PLACE IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF INDIA INCLUDING DELHI

2
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,391
BUT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE VIEWERS,
THE CHARACTERS COMMUNICATE IN TELUGU.

3
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,513
Chennai Tower, this is Deccan Air 582.

4
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,248
Minimum fuel.
Requesting landing clearance.

5
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,817
Go around, Deccan Air 582.

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,085
Unable to go around.

7
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,621
I said we have a fuel emergency,
goddammit!

8
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,458
-I say again, Deccan Air 582--
-Why aren't you letting me land?

9
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,294
There's something wrong.
They are ignoring protocol.

10
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,531
-Requesting reason for denial!
-You are not cleared to land!

11
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,834
-Why aren't you letting him land?-Who are you? Call the guards!

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,537
Maha? Maha, what's going on there?

13
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,307
-Why aren't they permitting me to land?
-Che, Tambaram Air Force. Runway 1-5.

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,676
Land there!
Do you have enough fuel for that?

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,111
There's enough fuel to land there.

16
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,946
-You sure you want us to proceed?
-I'm sure.

17
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,182
-It will be a problem, Maha.
-Land at Tambaram!

18
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,117
-I'll handle it!
-Roger.

19
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,692
-Stop running.
-Che, come in.

20
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,808
Parade!
Attention!

21
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,111
Keep going!
Careful!

22
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,480
Come in Tambaram Ground Control.

23
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,516
This is Captain Chaitanya Rao,
batch of 1987.

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,383
Please acknowledge.

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,519
You don't have permission
to land here, Captain.

26
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,522
This is military territory.
Turn around immediately! It's an order!

27
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,496
Come in, Che!

28
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,167
Careful.
You're flying into restricted area.

29
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,268
It's dangerous!

30
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,672
Go. Go fast!

31
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,450
-Security breach at gate number one!
-Hey.

32
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,784
-Stop, stop.
-Stop the vehicle.

33
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,753
Shit, shit, shit.

34
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,876
Che, are you okay!

35
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,978
Can you hear me, Che?

36
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,864
SURIYA

37
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,999
Che?

38
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,573
PARESH RAWAL

CO-STARRING
"PADMA SHRI" DR.MOHAN BABU.M

42
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,594
AAKAASAM NEE HADDHU RA!
[SKY IS YOUR LIMIT!]

43
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,180
How can you stuff yourself with meat
after a pilgrimage?

44
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:50,317
That chap's no longer in the army.
His relatives say he's unemployed.

45
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,654
Why are you so hell-bent on meeting him?

46
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,490
-What's the big deal?
-It's unprecedented.

47
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,759
It's unheard of for a girl's family
to visit a boy.

48
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,429
He refused to see you!
Why are you dying to see him?

49
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,331
Look, she's eating shamelessly!

50
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,401
He refused to treat me
like an animal for sale

51
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,569
that's why we're going.

52
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,205
She'll choose her husband
like Sita chose Lord Rama.

53
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,073
-Right, kiddo?
-Stop calling her kiddo.

54
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,742
You're spoiling this buffalo.
Stop taking her side.

55
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,846
Are you talking about me?
Am I really spoilt?

56
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,349
I'm the only one in the family
to clear 12th grade in one go.

57
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,185
You spent lakhs
to make this dimwit an engineer.

58
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,286
Don't drag me into this.

59
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,422
They are spending a fortune on you.

60
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,890
Shut her up, dad!

61
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:34,394
Listen girl,
only sons provide for parents.

62
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,865
Daughters move in with their
husbands after marriage and enjoy life.

63
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,600
Move!
You and your pearls of wisdom!

64
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,069
-Move aside!
-Do you get it, you witch?

65
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,470
Oh, my God!

66
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,208
This is what happens if you open
your mouth unnecessarily.

67
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,778
-Get your hands off me!
-I shouldn't have helped him!

68
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,547
Isn't this a reserved compartment?

69
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,583
What's that stench?
Dried fish? Yuck!

70
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,086
Well, you won't stop eating
once you taste this.

71
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,156
We will get off at Tsundur.
These seats will be all yours.

72
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,293
This is express train.
It doesn't stop at Tsundur.

73
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:10,063
It does! For the last six months,
our boy has not let

74
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,833
a single train pass Tsundur
without stopping there.

75
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,304
-That is Maha.
-Without so much as causing a ruckus!

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,741
So every time I travel to Vijayawada,
I've to deal with this crap?

77
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,977
You can keep these precious seats
all for yourself.

78
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,146
We won't be traveling
in trains anymore.

79
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,447
Then how are you going to travel?

80
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,583
-We're going to fly!
-Fly?

81
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,652
-He's bringing a plane to us!
-Yes!

82
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,654
-Who?
-Our Maha!

83
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,324
On this strange land

84
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:44,031
Brought to life by God
Behold the games of man

85
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,933
Behold the games

86
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:51,271
Behold man's mad games

87
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:55,042
On this round ball of dirt
Behold the strange game of man

88
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,612
When his eyelids last shut
He is but a procession on a hearse

89
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,149
Savor these sips of toddy

90
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,619
The one who's bathed
In toddy above is watching you

91
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,156
Rich or poor
All are dealt the same notch

92
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,793
In their final passage
all get blown the conch

93
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,363
Rich or poor,
all are dealt the same notch

94
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,700
On their final passage,
all get blown the conch

95
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,092
Evolved from apes we may have,
but our race saw no evolution

96
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,729
Behold our fate
Behold our ethics

97
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,232
Experience being a monkey
Its race and its ethics

98
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,334
Else, let it go and dance

99
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,005
Before the end of sweetness between us

100
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,441
This music can even raise the dead

101
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:05,112
The wraps come undone
when the drunks dance with joy

102
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,382
The wails of women light up and soar

103
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,785
Legions of near and dear
yet no one to tag along with him

104
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,556
Acres of lands were his
yet six feet of soil is what is

105
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,026
Legions of near and dear
yet no one to tag along with him

106
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,563
Acres of lands were his
yet six feet of soil is what is

107
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,801
The one dancing in the black shirt
is the groom.

108
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,037
-What!
-What is he doing?

109
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,774
The bride's family is here.
What are you doing?

110
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,877
-Did we come for this?
-This is humiliating.

111
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,312
They're staring at you.

112
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,947
Who cares?

113
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,115
That man danced for every death here.

114
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,085
The whole village
should dance on his death.

115
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:47,788
-Come and dance!
-Alright. Let's rock it!

116
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,499
-God forbid she starts dancing!
-Stop it.

117
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,002
Let's go.

118
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,680
Rocks. Palm trees.
Barren lands.

119
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,148
It'll all be your daughter's.

120
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,652
Yeah right! The groom doesn't seem
interested in the marriage.

121
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,922
Oh, no. He's keen too.

122
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,690
-Come on. Let's go inside.
-Come on!

123
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,158
Please have some fryums.

124
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,863
Did we come all the way
to eat fryums?

125
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,799
Don't you have cakes?

126
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,836
There's no toilet
how can they offer cakes?

127
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,838
Don't shush me.
It's the truth.

128
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,706
Since we're talking truths,

129
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,175
I'm completely broke.

130
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,977
I've a huge loan
and all I earn goes for repayment.

131
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,613
-Hey.
-No, he is just joking.

132
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,049
This land's worth a lot of money.

133
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:52,786
All I have is an idea
to start an airline.

134
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,088
But 24 banks have rejected it.

135
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,156
Look, mister.

136
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,393
Men are in a queue to marry
my beautiful and talented daughter.

137
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,762
I've been rejected by 20 men
so far.

138
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,730
-Shh! Silly girl. Shut up.
-Why?

139
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:09,903
I don't sew, cook, dance, or sing.

140
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,372
Mr. Military! She's just pulling your leg.

141
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,409
-She knows all that and more, right?
-Ignore him.

142
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,445
But I won't do any of it.
I just want to start a bakery.

143
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:22,216
Now that they have blurted out the truth,
there's nothing to talk about.

144
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,584
-Let's eat.
-Okay. Let's go.

145
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,353
-Let's eat and call it a day.
-Wait a minute.

146
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,691
It's not our tradition to eat unless
the discussion is fruitful.

147
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,894
And we don't let our guests go hungry.

148
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,996
-Let's go and eat!
-What?

149
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,401
So your friend's bringing planes
to this village?

150
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,903
-Yeah, bro.
-Enough.

151
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,371
Have you been on an airplane?

152
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,974
"Been on one"?
What are you talking?

153
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,377
I have a close friend who's a pilot.

154
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,213
He lets me drive when he gets tired.

155
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,716
It is true, believe me.

156
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,185
How will you finance your airline?

157
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,288
Hey, that's grown-up talk.
Why are you asking about it?

158
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,623
That's why I'm asking.

159
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,625
Let her ask.

160
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,994
So, 20 men rejected you?

161
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,665
Twenty four banks rejected you, right?
Can we talk about that?

162
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,166
They weren't that bright.

163
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,735
Those men weren't either.

164
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,005
One, two, three.

165
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,842
Just three steps to start an airline!
Seems easy.

166
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,077
Starting a bakery is easier.

167
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:25,979
Why haven't you done that yet?

168
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,915
I'm stuck at step one.

169
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,418
Looking for finance.
I'm waiting for money.

170
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,324
I know banks.
What is 'ven-tu-r capitalist'?

171
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,692
Venture Capitalist.

172
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,628
Banks give loans against collateral.

173
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,464
But for Venture Capitalist, VC

174
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,866
your idea is your collateral.

175
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,535
You get funds if they like your idea.

176
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,903
Oh!

177
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,738
Then you must find a VC.

178
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,941
Who is that? A VC?

179
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,510
-Did you like food?
-Yes, it is good.

180
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,845
Paresh Goswami.

181
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,546
He owns Jaz Airlines.

182
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,983
He realized his dream
with little to no help.

183
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,318
My hero.

184
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,856
With so many basic needs unfulfilled
in our country

185
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,524
who needs planes?

186
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,892
Stop talking like that.

187
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,061
A century ago,
they said we don't need electricity.

188
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,330
Fifty years ago,
they said we don't need cars.

189
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,031
-Who decides that?
-That is right.

190
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,633
The rich decide for the rest.

191
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,970
-Forget it. You won't get it.
-Is it? Shut up and eat.

192
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,872
Okay.

193
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,007
Okay with what?

194
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,209
With marrying you.

195
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,748
That was quick.
Are you insane?

196
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,253
Sometimes, no matter how hard we think,
we end up doing what we want.

197
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,555
-I don't like to waste time.
-That's Maha!

198
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,725
But I give enough thought
before making up my mind.

199
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,494
-There she goes.
- You'll know my decision in the morning.

200
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,098
That's my girl! Eat, dear.

201
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,441
You fussed about eating here.

202
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,778
But you missed the train
and has to stay back.

203
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:05,913
That is fate.

204
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,422
That way.

205
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,861
Hey!

206
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,731
You have a big house in the village.

207
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,634
Why do you stay in a place
where there's no electricity?

208
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,303
Getting electricity is no big deal.

209
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,105
Even teacher Rajaram's house
didn't have electricity 20 years ago.

210
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,540
With determination anything is possible.

211
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,309
-Hey! Air India!
-Air India! Air India!

212
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,577
-Air India!
-Where are you going?

213
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,278
I'm going to board Air India, Dad.

214
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,380
You want planes
when there are no roads?

215
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,082
First, learn to cut hair!

216
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,985
Is it a law that a son must do
his father's trade?

217
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,588
No matter what they study,

218
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,290
it's their fate
to get into the family business?

219
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,827
Keep the pot on your head, kid.
I'll do the rest in the morning.

220
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,596
Dad, it would look awkward!

221
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,631
What if I cut off your ear
in the dark?

222
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,566
First make the train
stop at our village.

223
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,269
Tsundur folks must go till Tenali
to take a train.

224
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,572
My father, the six-fingered
school teacher,

225
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,610
wrote numerous letters to the government
to make the train stop here.

226
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,678
How long will you keep writing?

227
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,680
As long as I can hold a pen.

228
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,618
Politicians go around happily
in trains and planes!

229
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,287
Why would they care about us?

230
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,258
The teacher kept writing petitions,
but nothing changed.

231
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,360
I picked up a stone.

232
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,162
-Hear us, Central Government!
-Hear us, Central Government!

233
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,532
-Stop the express train here!
-Stop the express train here!

234
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,967
-Tsundur beseeches you!
-Tsundur beseeches you!

235
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,936
-Deceive us, no more!
-Deceive us, no more!

236
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,972
Down with police brutality!

237
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,774
We want the train to stop here.

238
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,576
We want the train to stop here.

239
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:46,146
Stop it, stop it.
We want the train to stop here.

240
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,281
Stop the train here!

241
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,348
We want the train!

242
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,650
Stop it, stop it.

243
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:50,851
Maha!

244
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,222
Kasi!

245
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,524
-Kasi?
-Maha.

246
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:58,559
Take this.

247
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,029
-I can't open my eye.
-You'll be fine! I'm here!

248
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,999
What happened?
Oh my god! You're bleeding!

249
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,337
Your son pelted stones
to stop the train at Tsundur.

250
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,674
Kasi's badly injured.
He could have lost an eye.

251
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,810
What? Is it true?
Come on in first.

252
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,415
He would've been arrested!
They let him go because he's my son!

253
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,219
But God, the way they looked at me.

254
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,487
I was so ashamed!

255
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,357
The people of the village
honor my words,

256
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,327
but my own son
doesn't listen to me.

257
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,996
Dad, you've always said
time's precious.

258
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:39,166
And that the train stopping here
will change our lives.

259
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,035
You talk a lot about change.
Shouldn't I make it happen?

260
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,371
Hey, don't act like a stupid person.

261
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,373
Aren't you educated?
You're a teacher's son!

262
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,674
Stupid fellow.

263
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:51,945
If you want the train to stop here,
you should write to the division head.

264
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,047
Do you get it?
Can you do that?

265
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,349
You wrote petitions.

266
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,583
-Maha? Maha?
-What happened?

267
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:59,353
We got electricity because of that.
Get inside!

268
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,587
Not that petition, mom!

269
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,890
I know which petition
he's talking about.

270
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:03,724
Let him talk.

271
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,360
He hasn't eaten!

272
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,428
You know he blabbers
when he's hungry!

273
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:12,733
-Come in.
-If he has the guts, let him say it!

274
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,968
First thing tomorrow,
I'll have him arrested.

275
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,904
Don't say that.
He's our son!

276
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,306
What did you do when mom had
pregnancy complications?

277
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,576
You just sent petitions
asking for a medical camp!

278
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,810
-You'll have me arrested?
-Hey.

279
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,979
You should be arrested
for killing your child!

280
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,948
-Maha! Don't talk about it.
-Quiet, Mom!

281
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,384
Even now we took Kasi to town.

282
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,554
This armchair idealist will bury us all
with his petitions!

283
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,923
You're a bloody failure!
And will always be one!

284
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,292
Oh, my God!

285
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,527
What have you done? Maha...

286
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,264
If violence is wrong,
then why the hell did you just hit me?

287
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,933
Maha, mind your language.

288
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,073
-Thanks for the lesson, son.
-Oh, God.

289
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,776
Don't even light my pyre
when I die.

290
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,678
-Listen to me.
-Leave!

291
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,949
Maha!
What have you done?

292
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,984
Son, where are you going?

293
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,919
He's leaving!

294
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,889
Hey, Maha, don't go.
Where are you going?

295
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,525
And then what happened?

296
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:16,129
Then I joined the National Defense Academy
and then the Air Force.

297
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,798
Quite the angry man!

298
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,267
Were you as bad in the Air Force?

299
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,718
He says the snacks don't reach him.

300
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,786
-All the postal guys...
-Aunt!

301
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:41,788
Show it to him.

302
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,557
-The postal guys eat them up.
-Maha has sent a letter.

303
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,626
I'm sending two boxes this time!

304
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,794
With a note saying...

305
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:51,198
"You can take one box,
but give the other to my son."

306
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,466
Get it here!

307
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,734
Should I read it out?

308
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,337
I am a third grader,
and a teacher's wife!

309
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,839
I can read myself.

310
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,474
Look at him writing chits.

311
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,744
Writes letters for his son
and then hides them!

312
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,812
I will shred them one day!

313
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,748
"Dear Mom."

314
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,483
Look! He's listening.

315
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,719
"And dear Kasi...

316
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,521
Hope all is well.

317
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,057
I'm good here."

318
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,992
This shows how much he loves us.

319
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,495
"I passed my ex-cams, Mom."

320
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,764
-It's an 'exam', Aunt!
-That's what I said. Shut up!

321
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,266
"Chaitanya stood first.

322
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,537
And I was second.
Seby stood fourth.

323
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:36,176
I am a pilot officer
Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam now.

324
00:19:54,194 --> 00:20:00,200
There's an Officer called Naidu
who torments me with his rules

325
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:04,938
and tortures me with do's and don'ts,
just like our teacher!"

326
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,807
Bring this stupid Naidu to me.

327
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm going to break his neck
like I do with chickens.

328
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,447
Move round and round
Like a surging hurricane

329
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,084
Stomp over arrogance
Like a bull off its leash

330
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:24,224
A streak like the lightning
Tear it all down

331
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,794
Punch it and spread it dry
Then, dust it off and toss it out

332
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,796
Sir!

333
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,276
Come on, trainees!
Double up!

334
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,810
Move fast, I say!

335
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,981
Kasi, I'm fine! How are you?
Where's mom?

336
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,516
She's fine!

337
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,685
Get her quick!
I only have three minutes!

338
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,021
She's bringing your father!

339
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,523
She'll be here any second!
Hang on!

340
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,258
She's here, Maha!

341
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,826
Aunty, hurry up!

342
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,961
Ask them to hurry!

343
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,964
His leg hurts.

344
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,599
-Here, Aunt!
-Give it to me.

345
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,434
Hello, Maha?

346
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:10,971
-Mom?
-Maha? Your dad's come.

347
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,440
-Mom?-Shall I put him on, Maha.

348
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,342
-Mom, I can hear you.
-Maha?

349
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,643
I can't hear anything.

350
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:17,978
I can hear you.
Please talk.

351
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,213
Buddy?
Hello?

352
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,881
-Ask her to talk.-Can you hear me?

353
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,649
-Hello!
-Give it to his dad!

354
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,618
-The line got disconnected!
-Oh, no.

355
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,487
Kasi, I can hear you.
Give the receiver to dad.

356
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,890
Why will he talk to a failure?

357
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,292
He won't talk to me.

358
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,561
What are you saying?
Hold him!

359
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,963
Hello. Mom!

360
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,397
I'll just make one more call!

361
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,732
-Uncle?
-Please wait, dear.

362
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,000
-Chandra Mahesh?
-Sir!

363
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,502
People are waiting.

364
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,470
Everyone gets only three minutes.

365
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,073
Call next month!
Move! Move!

366
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,214
Logistically we can save a lot, sir.

367
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,183
How will one MI-26 alone suffice?

368
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,784
Since it's a joint exercise
with army,

369
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,987
we can transport airmen
in their armored troop carriers.

370
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,388
One chopper will do.

371
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,390
We ration fuel
and cut extra costs.

372
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,058
You will cut down nothing, Chandra Mahesh.

373
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,227
Don't be stingy.

374
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,362
Intelligence says,

375
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,664
the insurgent activity has risen
near the Sinhagad Fort.

376
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:13,166
We eliminate risk by increasing
our ground numbers.

377
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,001
And then we can go ahead, sir.

378
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,170
It's not being stingy,
It's being smart, sir.

379
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,506
-So... Chaitanya?
-Sir!

380
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,041
Is he saying I'm dumb?

381
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:21,875
No, sir!

382
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,313
Fifty rounds around the parade ground!

383
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,615
Fifty kilos dead weight!

384
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,751
Take your friends with you!

385
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,222
Hundred rounds. Eighty kilos.
In one and a half hours.

386
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:35,956
Move!

387
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,514
Baby, Baby? Hey, Baby?

388
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,316
-Hey, get up!
-Hey.

389
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,252
What are you doing with him
so late at night?

390
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,186
Get up!

391
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:12,626
Like a churn
You shook up my heart

392
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:18,165
Like in a war
You have shaken up my life

393
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:24,471
Like a pearl born in a shell
deep down in the ocean of milk

394
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:30,244
Give me a few glimpses of your beauty
to make me desire for more

395
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,879
You tigress!

396
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,082
Oh, tigress

397
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,088
This boy is your bounty

398
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,191
-Hey, Kasi!
-Yes, buddy?

399
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,331
Why is she so mad?
You two were just talking, right?

400
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,133
Why should I tell you?

401
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,970
After so many rejections,

402
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,974
I was scared,
my niece will remain a spinster.

403
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:04,545
This is an auspicious month.
Got to book a marriage hall soon!

404
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,714
You brought it this far.
Excellent job!

405
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,002
Over there.
He looks dashing, doesn't he?

406
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:33,740
No.

407
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,409
What the hell?

408
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,245
Are you saying no
to the marriage in the hall?

409
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:39,913
I am saying no to the marriage.

410
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,883
The boy himself has agreed!
Why are you declining?

411
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:44,985
Did you ask those 20 men
why they rejected me?

412
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,486
-That's different!
-Shut up.

413
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,456
May I ask why?

414
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,724
Yes! Yes you may!

415
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,528
You're already married
to airplane!

416
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,230
I'm married, too.

417
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:59,666
Let's make something
out of that first.

418
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:04,238
Serves you right for your arrogance.
The devil's just like you!

419
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,508
No loss, buddy.
She looks like a bun, anyway.

420
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,076
We can find someone better than her.

421
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,513
Shut up.
I'm sure she has her reasons.

422
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,247
Unbelievable.

423
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:17,718
Hey broker,
I'll deal with you later.

424
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,786
Did you bring us all the way to say no?

425
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,255
-What's your problem?
-What is your problem!

426
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,689
That I rejected him?

427
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,925
Or that you couldn't reject
your husband?

428
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,660
He is a good guy.
You can't find anyone like him.

429
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,195
-Drop them off.
-No way, buddy!

430
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:29,930
Let them walk.

431
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:34,067
It's a waste of fuel.
Hey, get into the vehicle.

432
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:41,775
Wealth and festivities, you lured away

433
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:47,114
I lay awake at nights
for you hacked away at my sleep

434
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:53,120
My wings are caught in the storm

435
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:59,593
You stirred my heart like a tornado

436
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:05,832
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
you have shown me your tricks

437
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:10,437
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

438
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,906
You shook me up

439
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:13,640
BABY BAKERY

440
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,946
I like you, lady

441
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:29,790
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
You have shown me your tricks

442
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:35,896
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

443
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,132
-We cannot give loans for airplanes.
-Sir, please listen to me.

444
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,535
You know we are a tiny rural bank.

445
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,338
Morning, ma'am.
Can I meet Mr. Mittal, Venture Capitalist?

446
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,607
- I am Chandra--
-I have many of these already, sir.

447
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,813
-I'll send it to the aviation minister.
-Thank you, sir.

448
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:04,725
A simple thing to say
spoken brash and blunt

449
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:10,697
I am amused to see myself in you
whenever you come in my sight

450
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:17,704
I wonder if I will ever lay my eyes
on a girl like you

451
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:22,809
Even if I am delayed by millennia
I will still seek you out

452
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,712
O my dimple-cheeked bird

453
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,248
I have wed you

454
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,987
And now, I am born again

455
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:41,695
Slipping spectacles onto my heart
You have shown me your tricks

456
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:47,701
By breaking the reins of my youth
You have sung your song

457
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,404
I can't meet anyone right now.
I'm late for my flight.

458
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,339
Sir.

459
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,411
-Mam, one meeting--
-Please give your card over there.

460
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,914
You always make these fritters.

461
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,983
Why can't you make cakes?

462
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,053
Look at the mugs wanting cakes!

463
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,788
Baby's Cakes!

464
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:12,159
Sweets from Tenali
for the spicy tongues of Guntur!

465
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,694
-Mr. Paresh Goswami...
-Look!

466
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:15,629
I already have a hundred of your cards!

467
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,898
You can't meet him.
Why don't you understand?

468
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,187
Are you a fortune teller
or a programmer?

469
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,489
-The logic's wrong. Override it.
-One second.

470
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,258
It's running, sir!

471
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,260
Source code ready!
Brilliant, sir!

472
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,494
It is running, sir!
Superb, sir!

473
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:49,162
Oh, really?

474
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,632
How many millions
are you going to make from this?

475
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:53,800
Corrupting IIT kids
with his lofty ideas!

476
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,436
You should become a professor at IIT, sir.

477
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,472
-Yes, sir. You should become a professor.
-Yes, sir.

478
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,573
Yes, sir!
You should!

479
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,376
If I was that smart,
I would have moved out of his place.

480
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,015
Both of you quit the Air Force
yapping about some big dreams.

481
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:09,349
What did you achieve...

482
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:10,684
Son-in-law!
Sebastian!

483
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,686
You need an ex-serviceman loan, right?

484
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,821
-Your friend's reputation precedes him.
-Bring my bag.

485
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:18,458
Especially now with Naidu sitting
in Tambaram!

486
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,594
-He's not going to sign.
-I can't hear you!

487
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,697
You eat my food
and pretend to not hear me.

488
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,032
-I can't hear you.
-Of course, you don't.

489
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:25,899
Thank you.

490
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:29,803
This loan won't be approved
without Naidu's recommendation letter.

491
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,505
So, I want you to shut up, okay?

492
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,641
Che went through a lot
trouble to get this appointment.

493
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,344
-So, you shut up! Understand?
-Hmm.

494
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:39,346
What "Hmm"?
Are you listening to me.

495
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,682
-I'm not deaf!
-Good boy! Go, go.

496
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,555
Chandra Mahesh,
let me spell it out for you.

497
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:53,327
Even though I can,
I won't sign this recommendation letter.

498
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:59,466
You want my best pilot Chaitanya to resign
and ruin his life.

499
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,502
I don't like people who break rules.

500
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,770
-You're not fit to be a leader!
-Let's go.

501
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:06,673
Sir.

502
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:12,713
Hey, Seby and Maha.
What happened?

503
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,148
The same crap even after all these years.

504
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,317
-Egoistic jackasses, both!
-Maha, stop.

505
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,821
Forget him and the banks.
Let's figure out our next move.

506
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:21,788
I just did.

507
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:23,056
Hold on, Maha.

508
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,594
-Twenty thousand rupees, yes?
-Yes.

509
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:29,396
-Have a nice journey.
-Thank you.

510
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,565
These people have nothing better to do.

511
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:35,102
Sir, I've just two boxes
of fryum and pickles.

512
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,237
-They'll be ruined if I check them in!
-That is not my problem, ma'am.

513
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,239
-You're delaying the passengers.
-My sister's pregnant.

514
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,207
Please come forward, sir.

515
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,875
-Do you know about pregnancy cravings?
-You have to check it in.

516
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:42,976
You are a man.
How can you know about it?

517
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,111
Ma'am, I can't help you.

518
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,579
Have you ever been pregnant?

519
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,214
Please send the manager
to counter number four.

520
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:48,348
Good. Call the manager!

521
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:51,118
-Is she a lady, she'll understand.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

522
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,719
I'll take them. No problem.

523
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,522
-I can take them.
-Thank you very much, sir.

524
00:30:55,622 --> 00:30:57,891
Look, he is with me.
Check me in now!

525
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,393
-Check me in, I say!
-Sure, ma'am.

526
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:00,160
Yes, give it to me.

527
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:02,229
You won't run off with these, will you?

528
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,830
Fryums and pickles.

529
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:05,098
Are you a reporter?

530
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:06,533
Yes, how did you know?

531
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,402
You ask too many questions.

532
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,205
Yeah!
Actually, this flight is full of media.

533
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,443
Paresh Goswami himself is flying us
to the RRTV Awards.

534
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:18,412
-Is that where you are going?
-Yes.

535
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,881
I've not seen you
in media before.

536
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:24,318
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
Senior Producer, All India Radio.

537
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:25,285
Okay.

538
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:26,553
Where are you going?

539
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:31,558
Am I bothering you
with my questions?

540
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:32,926
I still want an answer.
Please tell me.

541
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,261
-Where are you going?
-Thanks.

542
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:36,964
-To meet someone.
-Whom?

543
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,806
Good afternoon, sir.

544
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:52,946
-Excuse me.
-Sir?

545
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,016
My brother Bhawarlal's outside.

546
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,985
-Please send him in.
-Sure, sir! Sure, sir!

547
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,762
-Shall I cancel the flight?
-No, no.

548
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,398
It's just an anxiety attack.
It's okay.

549
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:12,332
Change your shirt.

550
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,202
Take your pill.

551
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:17,905
Bhawar.

552
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:24,945
Do the staff use the same restrooms
as the guests?

553
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:30,184
A steward just used one.

554
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,318
I'll have it cleaned.

555
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,421
Shivdas Airport Services.

556
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,456
I'll have him fired.

557
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,625
The Paresh Goswami?

558
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,961
Why do you want to meet such a big shot?

559
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,896
To discuss a business partnership.

560
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,332
There's no way you can meet him.

561
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,834
I'll make him my business partner.

562
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,569
Are you kidding?

563
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,071
He won't even talk to you.
Want to bet?

564
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,342
-What if he did?
-Out of the question.

565
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,911
At most, we can just applaud his speech.

566
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:04,484
Why are you getting up?
That call's for business class.

567
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:07,387
You didn't say what you'll do
if you lose.

568
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,756
I'll tell you what to do
when I win.

569
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,158
Business class?

570
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,726
You must be really rich.

571
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,563
Then why wait in the queue?
You're strange!

572
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:18,765
You spent 40,000
to fly in business class?

573
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,868
Didn't you say
I can't meet him at the event?

574
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,202
Hence, business class.

575
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:25,172
You don't need 40,000,
twenty's enough.

576
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,274
I'll be returning by train.

577
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:30,544
I'm not rich, I emptied
my bank account to buy the ticket.

578
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:33,180
Sir, anyways, please take care

579
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,415
of my fryums and pickles.

580
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,984
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

581
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,494
Good evening, sir.
Welcome on board.

582
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:50,030
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
Captain Sharma from the flight deck.

583
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,665
On behalf of first officer Matthew

584
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,467
and the crew,
we welcome you all

585
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:56,803
onboard Jaz Airlines, JZ 433
Chennai to Mumbai.

586
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,338
We have with us today,
our chairman, Mr. Goswami...

587
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:01,074
- Mr. Paresh, hello.-Our heartiest welcome to you, sir.

588
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,444
Right, sir.
I'll see you in Bombay.

589
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,651
Congratulations on the award, sir.
Proud moment for the Jaz family.

590
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:23,463
Hello, sir.
I'm Chandra Mahesh.

591
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:25,599
You're the inspiration
for my airline.

592
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,435
May I request you
to return to your seat, sir?

593
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,671
-Right, sir.
-It's fine.

594
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,538
Pleasure, sir.

595
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:36,977
You intend to start an airline?

596
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:42,749
Yes, sir.

597
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,353
An airline for the common man.
To travel at low-cost.

598
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,055
-Chandrababu?
-It's Chandra Mahesh.

599
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,626
Would these people you speak of
want three square meals a day

600
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,995
or fly in a plane?

601
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,297
Sir, I won't confuse them
with the choices.

602
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,199
With my ticket fare,
they can do both.

603
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,336
Are you planning
some kind of social service?

604
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,838
I want to execute this idea
with you, sir.

605
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:11,378
Everyone in here has an idea
to become a billionaire.

606
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:14,515
They all sound great.

607
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:16,984
But practically impossible.

608
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,686
I never waste time
talking about the impossible.

609
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,355
My idea's practically possible.

610
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:26,460
So you want to sell tickets
at a cheap price and still be profitable.

611
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:31,198
You're saying this didn't occur to us?

612
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:33,901
Yes, sir.

613
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:38,539
Today, no Indian can book air tickets
without a travel agency.

614
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,140
We all know that.

615
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,910
A big chunk of the fare goes
to the travel agent.

616
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,579
Like it goes to the middlemen
in farming.

617
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:47,147
What if we bypass that?

618
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:49,583
Bypass a travel agency?

619
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,554
Then how will customers book tickets?

620
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:54,421
The internet!

621
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,558
They book tickets
through computers.

622
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,592
Wow!

623
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:02,829
So a farmer who's never seen a computer
nor the internet

624
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,201
will book tickets thus and fly.

625
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,335
Fantastic!

626
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,606
Internet's available in 500 post offices
in AP alone.

627
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,410
And 1,453 Reliance petrol bunks
all over India has an internet facility.

628
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:17,544
They can book there!

629
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,747
Then the farmers won't need computers,
right?

630
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:25,285
But this requires
specialized booking software.

631
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:27,454
I don't think you're aware of it.

632
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,456
You must be aware of Interworld.

633
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:32,993
They make ticketing software
for all major airlines.

634
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,128
They've agreed to do it for me.

635
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,167
You can make
a tailor fly alongside a textile baron.

636
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,642
-Yes, I can make that happen.
-Sir.

637
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,112
But I won't.

638
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,048
Why, sir?

639
00:36:55,516 --> 00:37:00,921
Would anyone want to see
beggars and coolies on planes?

640
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,724
I don't want my passengers to suffer.

641
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:06,593
Is that why
your airfare is so expensive?

642
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,096
I have an airline to run, my friend.

643
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,864
-What you're doing is...
-Get him out.

644
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,366
Put him in economy.

645
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:18,472
Why the fuck should I go?
I've bought the ticket.

646
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,941
Lay a hand on me,
I'll rip your throat out.

647
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,648
Ladies and gentlemen,

648
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,516
this is Captain Sharma again,
from the flight deck.

649
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,419
Unfortunately, the aircraft is developed
a technical snag.

650
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,121
We need to turn around to Chennai.

651
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,827
You own the ticket.

652
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:43,397
I own the plane, my friend.

653
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,242
-This way. sir.
-This way.

654
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,744
I know the drill.
My job here's done.

655
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:58,579
Ma'am.

656
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,181
Your fryums and pickles.

657
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,016
-Thank you.
-See you.

658
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,819
-Chandra Mahesh, careful.
-Yeah? Thanks.

659
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,587
Bye.

660
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:14,161
Mr. Chandra Mahesh,
I was on that flight, too.

661
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,463
I heard what you told Paresh.

662
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:20,434
I'm Prakash Babu.
SCI Venture Capitalists.

663
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,402
I know.
I've been to your office many times.

664
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:25,138
Alright.
I'll give you the time now.

665
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:25,973
Okay?

666
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,542
Five minutes.
Come along.

667
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:34,248
-Take care of table two.
-Okay, sir.

668
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,585
Mahesh, if you're hungry,

669
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,320
we could've gone
to the five-star hotel nearby.

670
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,956
There's no better place
to explain my idea to you, sir.

671
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:44,358
-Brother, how are you?
-Fine, brother.

672
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,159
-What can I get you? Okay.
-Dosa, please.

673
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,562
What's the connection
between Udupi hotel and airline?

674
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,266
Today, an air ticket to Delhi
costs Rs. 12,000.

675
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,334
First class costs 20,000.

676
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,335
Definitely.

677
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,571
Running airline is an expensive affair.

678
00:38:57,704 --> 00:39:02,242
Flight maintenance, hangar charges,
pilot salary, fuel costs...

679
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:03,777
It's a costly business!

680
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:04,611
Dig in.

681
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,180
Please have it.

682
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,550
They did not get Poori. Please check.

683
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:19,793
How is it, sir?

684
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,862
Actually, it's tasty.

685
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,864
-Very good.
-Thank you, sir!

686
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:24,698
It's delicious.

687
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,433
Brother!

688
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:30,304
-Where do you get your provisions?
-Chintamani stores at More market!

689
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,172
Who is their biggest customer?

690
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,875
The five-star hotel
in the neighboring street.

691
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:37,778
You know what's funny?

692
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:40,647
We provide dinner for their staff too!

693
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:41,882
You continue, please.

694
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,653
Have you had dosa
at the five-star hotel nearby?

695
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:50,457
When I get good dosa here
for 16 bucks,

696
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,659
why will I waste 200 bucks there?

697
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:53,827
Sure, brother.

698
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:57,764
-The dosa's great here. Enjoy!
-Okay, brother.

699
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:59,099
Do you get it, sir?

700
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,801
Everyone's happy.

701
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:04,838
The same dish is sold under a fancy name
at the five-star hotel.

702
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,074
Only difference is, this is cheaper.

703
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,476
But no difference
in taste and hygiene.

704
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,944
No needless expenses.

705
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,280
My airline will operate in the same way.

706
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,183
Why have food and newspapers
on an hour-long flight?

707
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:18,519
I will neither provide them
nor charge for them.

708
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,287
Ten percent of costs drop right away.

709
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,156
We keep our flights very light.
No extra food no staff.

710
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,826
Other airlines do two trips a day.
We will do six.

711
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:26,960
Six trips?

712
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:27,761
How?

713
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:29,897
There is Flight Duty Time Limitation.

714
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,334
Staff cannot fly
for more than eight hours.

715
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:35,802
Let's plan three shifts.

716
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:38,305
Three shifts.
Eighteen hours of flying time.

717
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:41,775
Deduct C&D checks, cleaning, and fueling,
we still fly 14 hours.

718
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,211
Only humans tire.
Planes don't, right?

719
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,880
But, this isn't the norm.

720
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:47,881
It's not the convention.

721
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,751
Let's change it.
Let's break every damn rule.

722
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:52,819
Look, sir.

723
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:55,389
No table's empty,
no waiter's idle.

724
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:59,193
Simply put,
our airline's the Udupi Hotel in the sky.

725
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,530
You didn't tell me you were starting
an Udupi Hotel!

726
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,632
-Not on this street.
-Then, it's fine!

727
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:07,167
-If I...
-Say no?

728
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,803
I've tried 23 VCs and 56 banks
so far.

729
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,141
And all they said was,
"Who is this crazy fool?"

730
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:17,744
If you say the same,
I'll just go find VC number 24.

731
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:18,645
I'm done.

732
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:25,652
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

733
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:35,662
-Mahesh.
-Sir!

734
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:39,600
Come to my office next month.
8th of April.

735
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,969
Convince the rest of the board.

736
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:44,605
-Okay? Bye.
-Yeah.

737
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:48,609
There's a girl named Nagalakshmi.

738
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:51,845
My mom's blackmailing me
into meeting her.

739
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:54,948
Let me go over there
and set that right!

740
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:04,391
The kids have gone nuts after you
showed them that film on planes.

741
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:09,296
We were doomed to carts, Subba.
At least, let the kids fly!

742
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,934
My bike can't go any faster!

743
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,170
Maha, wait!

744
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:34,988
WELCOME TO
GUNTUR MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION

745
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,591
Unfortunately, I borrowed
from that damn loan shark Ravi!

746
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,660
He comes here every day without fail

747
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:41,328
and hounds me for money!

748
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,129
Hey, you bloody...

749
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,497
Isn't this that girl's shop?

750
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,766
Your mom told us to meet Nagalakshmi.
Let's go!

751
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,968
-Let's buy sweets!
-Hello, son-in-law!

752
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,603
What brings you here?

753
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:51,405
Get down.

754
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:54,341
You rejected us
and now call him son-in-law?

755
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:56,310
Load up two kilos of cakes!

756
00:42:56,443 --> 00:43:00,581
Is this a scrap shop? It's a bakery!
It's "pack two kilos of cakes."

757
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,115
Whatever!

758
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:03,817
Give me samples of these two.

759
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:07,287
Eating for free is called 'sampling', eh?
Nasty habit!

760
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:11,658
How dare you come here
after calling me a bun?

761
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,194
Let's go, buddy.
It's a bullshit bakery!

762
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:15,395
Are you married?

763
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:17,631
Yes. Two kids. You?

764
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,466
-What about you?
-We're meeting a prospective bride.

765
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:20,734
That's why we stopped here
for sweets.

766
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,370
So you've been at it for three years?

767
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,706
Where's the airplane company?

768
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,642
You know VC?
The venture capitalist?

769
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:30,043
They've okayed my project.

770
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:33,180
Few formalities left on DGCA licenses,
and NOC.

771
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,516
So you're still on the step one?

772
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:37,584
I'm already on the step three!

773
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:38,986
Hello?

774
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,221
I'm going to launch in a month!

775
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,490
-I see...
-Ah, now you're gobsmacked?

776
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,125
You wish!

777
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:49,129
Had you bought an auto or bus,
you would've made some money!

778
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,998
What does your husband
do for a living?

779
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:54,535
We're set to open another branch,
mind you!

780
00:43:54,868 --> 00:43:56,370
What does the little one want?

781
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,539
-Freshly made cakes!
-Why are you crying?

782
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:01,475
-Fifty rupees discount for you!
-Do you want a cake?

783
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:02,876
Okay, don't cry!

784
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:05,846
Why is he so pissed?

785
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:06,980
-Shall we go?
-Let's eat a cake.

786
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,650
Do you call this cake?
It's disgusting.

787
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,752
Sugary crap!
Spit it out!

788
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,320
It's pretty good, buddy!

789
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,154
Hey.

790
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:16,723
No human can eat these.

791
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,193
Damn country bumpkins!
Country brute.

792
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,929
Would any sane person open a bakery
near a liquor shop?

793
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:24,164
Should've been near a school
or college.

794
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,733
You need brains to work that out!

795
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:31,338
Buddy!
Maha!

796
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:33,240
I found out something.

797
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,275
Nothing happened.

798
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,511
What are you talking about?

799
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:40,247
That bun girl isn't married yet!

800
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:44,251
Her loudmouth uncle told me!

801
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,754
Can I eat her cakes now?

802
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,892
Sweets from Tenali
for the spicy tongues of Guntur!

803
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,962
Milk cakes! Cheesecakes!
Butter cakes!

804
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:58,298
Buy one, get one free!

805
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,167
Baby's cakes!
Yummy cakes!

806
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,035
-Those were your friend's kids, right?
-Amazing taste.

807
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:03,136
Why did you bluff?

808
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,638
Paneer cake!
Made by Baby Bakery!

809
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,974
-Why did you lie to me?
-Milk cake, butter cake,

810
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,242
-Hey, bun face!
-Baby...

811
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,446
Listen to me!
The world calls us crackpots.

812
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,014
No one would come forward
to marry us.

813
00:45:14,615 --> 00:45:15,983
So why don't we get married?

814
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:16,917
What do you say?

815
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:18,085
Oh, really?

816
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:21,555
So why didn't you see this crackpot
in three years?

817
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:23,957
Back then,
I couldn't even feed myself.

818
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:27,160
Those barren lands are green now!
Good income!

819
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:30,397
My business kicks off in a month!
Good enough, right?

820
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:35,502
Amazing taste! Super taste!
Baby's Bakery!

821
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,237
And if it fails?

822
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:39,640
Who says it's only a husband
who provides for the wife?

823
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:41,108
Won't you feed me?

824
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:45,679
What do you say, bun face?

825
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,948
I got three conditions.

826
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:49,183
What are they?

827
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,152
It's a bait, kiddo.
Don't fall for it!

828
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:56,089
One, it's our money,
not your money or my money.

829
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,191
Got it.

830
00:45:57,324 --> 00:46:01,929
Two, my business
is as important as yours. Got it?

831
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:03,564
Sure.

832
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:06,099
This is 2.1, your brain can't process
more than two points.

833
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,135
-Hey.
-Our family's very important to me.

834
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,805
And if you let us down,
I'll poison your food!

835
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,942
If you agree to these conditions,
we can marry tomorrow.

836
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,977
I already said yes to all of it!

837
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,179
You better think hard

838
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,547
because I won't divorce you.

839
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:21,782
I won't ask for it either.

840
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,550
Okay. How come you agreed now?

841
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,385
Sometimes,
no matter how hard we think,

842
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:27,788
we end up doing what we want.

843
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,122
Why waste time?

844
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,059
Come on over!

845
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:33,961
Buy one loony,
get another free!

846
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,963
Buy two loonies,
get both free!

847
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:38,532
Both loonies are available!
Come get them!

848
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:58,385
Kohl-eyes light up looking at you
Oh boy

849
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:04,391
Words fail me
As if I am chewing on the water

850
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:10,564
Like a home adorned with colorful
Designs my heart is resounding with joy

851
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:16,336
Like gathered neem leaves
A procession is arriving my way

852
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:22,442
You caress me like the coins
In the folds of my saree

853
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:28,882
You are the noise
That keeps me up all night

854
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:33,787
My desires, once like a dried-up forest
Suddenly blossom

855
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:39,259
My heart revolves around you
And asks to give me yours

856
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,929
I, Sundari aka Baby,
Who lives in Tenali...

857
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:50,437
To all of you who came to this wedding

858
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:53,807
jam cakes will be provided.
With cameraman Rani, this is Mangaraju.

859
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,531
Ward off the evil eye!

860
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,066
Just thirty bucks?

861
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,667
-You deserve less.
-Oh, really?

862
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:29,643
Like the pigeon perched atop a tower
I look for you in directions many

863
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:35,349
Whenever I hear a little flutter
My heart hops like a hare

864
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:38,685
Should I open my heart and spill
Or shed my shame and tell?

865
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,455
I desire no one but you

866
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:47,261
You pinch my cheek
And tame the wild fire I hold tight

867
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:53,267
Sting me like a wasp

868
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:58,972
Coil around me like a python

869
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,676
Baby, for your new bakery.

870
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:08,982
-Baby?
-Yes, bro?

871
00:49:09,716 --> 00:49:11,618
-Can I hang it here?
-Put it over there!

872
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,655
When you see it,
you'll be stunned, madam.

873
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:17,891
With the college nearby,
the business will soar.

874
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:19,960
Imagine my cakes being sold here.

875
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:25,666
Do you know what this is?
A pager.

876
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,067
We can talk easily
if it is a phone, right?

877
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,702
-What to do with it?
-It's for you.

878
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:32,673
This thing looks a little off!

879
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:33,841
You try drawing it!

880
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:38,378
As the plane's weight increases,
so will fuel cost.

881
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:39,880
An airline in America...

882
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:40,981
Pay attention!

883
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,852
They cut down 500 pounds
by not painting their flights!

884
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,687
That's four people flying for free!

885
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,555
So you don't like weight?

886
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,874
Without a sword
You nipped my beauty

887
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,843
Without the touch of your fingernail
You pinched my waist!

888
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,946
Oh my
You behave like you are unaware

889
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,516
You ignite and slide away
So cleverly

890
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:17,384
When I am next to you

891
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:21,555
Like a pot of spicy fish curry
My youth simmers

892
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:25,025
Like a hot plate of delicacy
I'll caress your taste buds

893
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,394
Do savor it all day

894
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:31,131
Crack the knuckles of my fingers slowly

895
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,934
Smoothen out the folds of my saree

896
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:37,104
The craze for you has trapped me
And it refuses to leave

897
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:41,975
I'll string you onto me
Like a chain of black beads

898
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:48,148
I'll attach you to me
Like backbone

899
00:50:55,455 --> 00:51:00,460
To sum it up, passengers must be able to
buy plane tickets, like they do soaps.

900
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,729
Together, we can make this happen.
That's it.

901
00:51:03,197 --> 00:51:03,897
Thank you.

902
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,733
Indian Airlines
has a thousand crore debt.

903
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,803
And you want to make profits
with thousand rupee tickets to Delhi?

904
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:12,406
My competitor is the Indian Railways,
not Indian Airlines.

905
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:15,042
-Indian Railways?
-And they are doing very well.

906
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:19,079
A Boeing plane costs 136 crores,
Mr. Mahesh.

907
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:21,415
Even a second-hand one
costs 90 crores.

908
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,617
What can you do with just ten crores?

909
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,252
I didn't say I was buying planes.

910
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,921
We'll lease them.

911
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:30,791
What if your revenue is less
than expected?

912
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:35,262
At 70% occupancy, like most airlines,
we can earn 12.42 crores.

913
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:37,331
That's a profit of 4.14 crores.

914
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:38,465
Sounds impossible.

915
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,300
-Deeksha?
-He's right.

916
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:41,735
Oh! Let me see that!

917
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,338
If it's less than 70% occupancy?

918
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:47,241
If it's 70% at ten thousand rupees
per ticket,

919
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:51,111
won't I get at least 50% occupancy
with thousand rupee tickets?

920
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:53,714
You are talking way below market rates.

921
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,618
Who will lease Boeings to you
at such low rates?

922
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:59,353
-PlaneAm.
-Really?

923
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:05,125
The Twin Tower attack
affected their airline business.

924
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,861
They're willing to give us planes
at half the price.

925
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:16,370
Congratulations, Mahesh.

926
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:17,738
They've sanctioned funds.

927
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:21,575
If we get the DGCA license
then we can launch our airline.

928
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:24,178
Well done, Maha.

929
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:25,379
All thanks to you, sir.

930
00:52:25,512 --> 00:52:26,980
-No, no. It's okay.
-If you weren't here...

931
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,715
-Just one thing.
-Sir.

932
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:31,952
Can you get an advance ready
and reserve the planes right away?

933
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:32,753
Advance?

934
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,421
-You want me to pay the advance?
-Yes.

935
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,890
-How much would you need, Mahesh?
-47 lakhs.

936
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:40,194
It will take at least four to five months
to release funds.

937
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,429
If PlaneAm hikes their rates
in the meantime,

938
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:45,365
or if someone else steals this idea,
we'll be in trouble.

939
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,601
Our entire business hinges on this.

940
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:49,837
Unlicensed planes can't fly into India.

941
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:53,507
Get them to Malaysia
and start painting and stickering there.

942
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:56,410
We'll get them to India
once we get the license.

943
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:58,412
I like this idea, sir.
I'll handle this.

944
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:17,364
Folks come by to get loans
for tractors and autos.

945
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:20,567
You're the first to ask for airplanes!

946
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,368
Alright then.

947
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:25,272
What a proud moment
if one of ours starts an airline!

948
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,908
I had a lot of dreams in my youth.

949
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,643
But no one gave me money then.

950
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,311
Projected profit
for the first six months...

951
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,781
That's okay.
I'm allergic to computers.

952
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:38,919
-How much, ma'am? 47 lakhs?
-Yes. 47 lakhs.

953
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,722
Check if this loan's feasible.

954
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:45,092
Don't mistake me.
Just standard procedure.

955
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:47,127
Depending on current rates,
its value is 40 lakhs.

956
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:49,296
They want an excess of seven lakhs!

957
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:51,098
We can't give money
without these documents.

958
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,166
He's my teacher's son!

959
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,768
-Give him the money.
-Alright.

960
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:00,274
Sign these documents, ma'am.

961
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:03,810
You're starting a business.

962
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,779
It is good to face east and sign.

963
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:11,618
If you default payment by even a day
the next three months,

964
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,654
-you'll have to pay two-fold interest.
-I'll pay on time.

965
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:14,788
Brother, that's okay.

966
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,959
Ma'am, please go.
I'll send the money over.

967
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,461
-What's next?
-Get a license from the DGCA.

968
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,597
-What's that?
-Like the RTO office in town?

969
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:26,166
We need a license from them to fly.

970
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,168
Replay the reel from the beginning!

971
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:33,240
Okay, sir.
I will take care of this.

972
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:37,978
Why did you give him an appointment?

973
00:54:38,812 --> 00:54:41,448
He was referred by Prakash Babu
from SCI.

974
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,150
He's been waiting for two months.

975
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,819
He should know
meeting DGCA isn't easy.

976
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:47,221
-Let him wait.
-Yes, sir.

977
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,795
Sir, you asked me to come to 8:30 am,
but I was here at 7 am.

978
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:57,798
I was here before the peon.
Yet, you haven't called me.

979
00:54:57,898 --> 00:54:59,800
-Please wait!
-Sir...

980
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,336
-Sir, first appointment was given to me.
-Excuse me.

981
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:06,874
Get going, all of you.
Sir will be back in an hour.

982
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,082
Car's ready, sir.

983
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,552
I'm Mahesh.
Mr. Prakash Babu reference.

984
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,255
-I'm sorry. You're still here?
-It's alright.

985
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,524
I have an urgent meeting
with the new aviation minister.

986
00:55:24,057 --> 00:55:25,759
-Can we meet tomorrow?
-Sure, sir.

987
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:27,294
-Nice.
-Thank you.

988
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,028
Bye.

989
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,035
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

990
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,115
Oh, Mahesh.

991
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,517
-I went through your documents.
-Oh, thanks.

992
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:52,052
-Very interesting.
-Sir.

993
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,787
We can wrap it up tomorrow, right?

994
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:55,022
-Yes.
-No problem, right?

995
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:57,624
-Okay, sir. I'll wait.
-Nice.

996
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,561
Did you set up a meeting
with the aviation minister?

997
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:01,762
I spoke to his PA.

998
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:03,263
-When is it?
-Tomorrow.

999
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,167
Mahesh?

1000
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:09,436
Sir?

1001
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:12,072
We wrap it up today, right?

1002
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,408
He's off for a week.
Didn't you know?

1003
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:15,776
Come back later.

1004
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:20,781
You're his assistant, right?

1005
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:23,116
It's your job to keep him posted.

1006
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,321
You're a smart guy, right?
I can only tell you what he tells me to.

1007
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,991
How long will you make me wait!

1008
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:32,659
Just for one meeting...

1009
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,729
I don't have the time or money for this.

1010
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:38,632
-Please, sir.
-Then why do you keep coming, sir?

1011
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,802
Do you know Ratan Tata, Mahesh?

1012
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:45,439
He waited here for 20 years
to start Tata Airlines.

1013
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:47,641
He failed.
And you are a nobody, Mahesh.

1014
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:51,178
Get going.
Understand, man.

1015
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:54,982
Don't show up next week!

1016
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,656
Either pay the interest
or give your house to Ravi.

1017
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:06,860
Don't you trust us?
We will return your money.

1018
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:10,430
Painting charges ate up all our money!
Just two lakhs left!

1019
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:14,701
A scientist's amazing journey
from Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

1020
00:57:14,835 --> 00:57:18,105
A special interview
with President Abdul Kalam

1021
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:23,010
by Chitra Ramarao,
our senior news reporter from Chennai.

1022
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,578
This is All India Radio.

1023
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:26,780
An amazing journey
from Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

1024
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:29,016
Damn!
So much security!

1025
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:31,151
-If we get caught, we're doomed!
-We won't.

1026
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:33,854
That stupid bet was a joke!

1027
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:35,689
This isn't like meeting Paresh
on a jet!

1028
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:38,058
We can't just sneak in
through the door!

1029
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:40,460
Can I tell you something?
I learned it from my experience.

1030
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:44,298
If the door's ajar,
don't just get a foot in. Dash in!

1031
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:47,835
I can't lie to the President, Mahesh.
Hello!

1032
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:50,037
It's not wrong to lie
for a good cause.

1033
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:54,808
-Falsehood takes on truth's nature.
-What?

1034
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:57,744
It is said so in the Bhagavad Gita!
The man inside knows it well! Madam.

1035
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,847
It's not news
if I don't meet him.

1036
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:00,581
-But...
-Sir, this way.

1037
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,448
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

1038
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:05,285
If I do meet him,
you get an exclusive headline!

1039
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:09,623
Do you really think I'm convinced?

1040
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:13,594
I'm staking everything to do this

1041
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:19,066
only because I'm just another sheep
among a billion here!

1042
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,702
And I hope you won't become one.

1043
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,903
-You better deliver...
-Excuse me, ma'am.

1044
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,771
- ...on your promises.
-Please follow me.

1045
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,174
Ma'am, papers, please.

1046
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:31,078
One second.

1047
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,584
-This is for...
-Thank You.

1048
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:40,020
Mr. Raghunandan.
My voice recordist.

1049
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:45,993
Just a pen.

1050
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:50,964
By the way, don't quote anything inside.
You were doing it all wrong!

1051
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:55,402
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
This is my voice recordist, Raghunandan.

1052
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,770
Raghunandan, Raghunandan.

1053
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,773
I'm Chitra Ramarao.
This is my voice recordist, Raghunandan.

1054
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,507
This way, please.

1055
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,777
Your ID?

1056
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:06,013
-Sir, your ID, please.
-Yeah.

1057
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:08,715
See, actually, we both are a team.
This is my ID.

1058
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:10,884
Sir, I need to see your ID.

1059
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:12,586
Raghunandan, voice recordist.

1060
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:13,754
Sir, your photo ID, please.

1061
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,756
See, we have documentation
from downstairs.

1062
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,558
-No, ma'am!
-Sir, I'm not from the radio station.

1063
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:18,992
I'm Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam.
I just need two minutes.

1064
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,961
-Please let me see him, sir. Please, sir.
-No, you are not allowed.

1065
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:21,728
Please listen to me.
Sir.

1066
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:24,464
If I could make
a two days trip in two hours,

1067
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,133
I would've seen my father alive!

1068
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:29,436
I want to start a low cost airline,
but they won't let me, sir!

1069
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,604
-Sir!
-Mister?

1070
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:31,638
Are you a Telugu?

1071
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:32,739
Yes, sir!

1072
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,008
I just need two minutes of your time!

1073
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:37,077
After that, if you think I'm wrong,
have me arrested!

1074
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,414
-Dhanraj, please let him in.
-Yes, sir!

1075
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,952
Security under control.

1076
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,129
-Good day, sir.
-Greetings, sir.

1077
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:57,264
Greetings!

1078
00:59:58,031 --> 00:59:59,933
I'm from a small village
near Tsundur.

1079
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:02,669
My father was a government school teacher.

1080
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:07,808
Hello?

1081
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,276
-Maha.-Mom?

1082
01:00:10,077 --> 01:00:10,944
Mom?

1083
01:00:12,546 --> 01:00:16,216
Your father's been bedridden
for two weeks now.

1084
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:22,389
He's holding on just to see you.

1085
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:27,361
The doctor says he won't survive.

1086
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:32,232
Tell dad I'll be home tomorrow by 11 AM.

1087
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,701
My son, Maha!

1088
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:37,070
-I'll be there! Be brave!
-Hurry!

1089
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:39,339
-I'll come, Mom!
-Come soon!

1090
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:42,743
Oh, God.

1091
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:45,679
-Be careful.
-For the flight fare!

1092
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,314
Hurry!
You can catch the 8 pm flight!

1093
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:49,316
-I'll do the money order.
-Shut up!

1094
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:54,054
This is 6,000.
The ticket is for 11,200 business-class.

1095
01:00:56,223 --> 01:00:58,792
Economy costs 6,000, right?

1096
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:00,594
Those are fully booked now, sir.

1097
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:01,795
Excuse me, sir. Please.

1098
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:02,596
No...

1099
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,731
Is there anything else you can do?

1100
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:07,000
-I'm sorry. We don't give discounts.
-Any cancellation?

1101
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,435
Sir, here you go with your money.

1102
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:09,703
Please move.

1103
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:10,871
-I need...
-Sir, try and understand.

1104
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:11,939
Please move aside.

1105
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:12,940
Ma'am, please.

1106
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,107
-Excuse me.
-Sir.

1107
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:16,109
My dad's unwell.
I need to meet him.

1108
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:18,512
I only have 6,000, but she is asking me
to take a first-class...

1109
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:19,713
Please move. They're waiting.

1110
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,316
Alright! I'll get the money.
How much time do I have?

1111
01:01:22,816 --> 01:01:24,518
-My God!
-How much time do I have?

1112
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:26,520
Five minutes.

1113
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:27,955
Excuse me.

1114
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,389
Move, now.

1115
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:31,225
When is the next flight?

1116
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:34,728
When is it?

1117
01:01:35,395 --> 01:01:36,196
In two days.

1118
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:38,732
Oh, God! The smell.

1119
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:41,168
Please move aside, sir!

1120
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:43,770
Two days!

1121
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:45,739
Two...

1122
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,308
Sir. Sir. Sir.

1123
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:51,144
My father's unwell, sir.
I need to buy a ticket.

1124
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:52,946
It's urgent.
It's an emergency, sir.

1125
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,482
When you're flying,
you should bring money.

1126
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:56,216
Okay?

1127
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,087
Ma'am.

1128
01:02:00,153 --> 01:02:01,655
Ma'am, If you can
please help me.

1129
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,323
Sir, I need to get this ticket.

1130
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:06,193
-Can you help me with some more money?
-Sorry mister, no.

1131
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:07,561
Is he mad?

1132
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:08,695
Crazy people.

1133
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,140
Ma'am.

1134
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:21,675
Time is running out.

1135
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,310
My father is not well.
It's an emergency.

1136
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:25,045
-Boarding closes in five minutes.
-No, just leave.

1137
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:27,814
I need to go to Hyderabad.
The last plane leaves in five minutes.

1138
01:02:28,982 --> 01:02:30,017
Sir.

1139
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:32,753
It's an emergency.
My father is very sick.

1140
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,621
I need to see him.
I don't have money for a ticket.

1141
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:36,490
-Please give him some, dad.
-Sir, at 11 o'clock...

1142
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:39,026
Gautam, just shut up
and read your comic.

1143
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:41,028
Please lend me the money!

1144
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:41,962
I can give you...

1145
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:43,630
I can give you my gold ring!

1146
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:45,299
I can give you my address
and phone number.

1147
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:47,201
Sir, please.
Please understand!

1148
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,836
Security!
What's with this nuisance?

1149
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:49,570
Sir, please help me.

1150
01:02:49,636 --> 01:02:51,338
Sir, I can...
I can show you my...

1151
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,073
I'm an '87 batch Air Force Officer.

1152
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:55,909
Please can somebody understand?
Can somebody please help me?

1153
01:02:56,043 --> 01:02:59,279
Give me your address and phone number,
I can definitely give the money back.

1154
01:02:59,346 --> 01:03:00,247
I promise. I promise.

1155
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,683
I really need this money.
Boarding closes in five minutes!

1156
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,484
I'm Chandra Mahesh.
House number 7,

1157
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:08,188
Anjaneyaswami temple street,
Kullupalam,

1158
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:11,491
Tsundur, Guntur district-522318.

1159
01:03:11,592 --> 01:03:12,593
This is my address, please.

1160
01:03:12,726 --> 01:03:14,761
I will come
and give you the money back.

1161
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:16,563
Someone, please help me!

1162
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,931
-Sir, please help me.
-Hey.

1163
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:18,966
Don't touch my bag.

1164
01:03:19,032 --> 01:03:20,234
Sir, please help me.

1165
01:03:20,834 --> 01:03:21,735
Ma'am.

1166
01:03:24,238 --> 01:03:25,606
My father is on the deathbed.

1167
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:28,175
I must see him.
Please help me, ma'am!

1168
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:31,178
Sir, I don't want to beg here!
But I need to be on that plane!

1169
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:33,213
I need to see my father.
I need to go, sir.

1170
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,382
I'm running out of time.
Somebody, please help me!

1171
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:37,150
Somebody, please help me!

1172
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:39,720
-My mother's old and alone!
-Come out, I say!

1173
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:42,756
I must be on that plane.
My father is on the deathbed.

1174
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:45,692
I must be on that plane.

1175
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:55,936
What's wrong?

1176
01:03:57,404 --> 01:04:00,407
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. Let me check.

1177
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,744
SHRI RENUKA YALLAMMATALLI LORRY SERVICES

1178
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:11,585
You're a bloody failure!
And will always be one!

1179
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:38,679
Who is it?

1180
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:50,757
You taught thousands to write
and you can barely scribble now!

1181
01:04:55,696 --> 01:04:58,498
The train has to stop here!

1182
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:01,168
I can't open my eye, Maha!

1183
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:26,994
You were his only child

1184
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:32,566
and you couldn't even light his pyre!

1185
01:05:39,907 --> 01:05:41,041
Why did you come?

1186
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:45,312
Why the hell did you come?

1187
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:48,582
Why the hell did you come?

1188
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:53,687
Why did you come
after everything's over?

1189
01:05:55,822 --> 01:05:57,891
This is all my fate!

1190
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:04,932
He longed for you
until the very end!

1191
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:12,539
Had you just seen him once

1192
01:06:12,673 --> 01:06:15,475
he would've gone peacefully!

1193
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:18,946
He said you wouldn't want
to speak to a failure!

1194
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:21,381
You deserted us
and walked away.

1195
01:06:21,515 --> 01:06:23,617
He waited until the end
for your return.

1196
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,087
Let go of my feet!

1197
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:31,158
-We both had such high hopes with you!
-Father.

1198
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:35,229
The breath he held on to,

1199
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:40,234
imagining you were back,
will never return!

1200
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,769
He died waiting for you!

1201
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:45,138
You bloody wretch!

1202
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:47,608
-Those who are executed get one last wish.
-I didn't have enough money.

1203
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,376
You deprived him of that, too!

1204
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:54,781
You never understood him.
See it for yourself.

1205
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:57,050
You can read, right? Read them.

1206
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,785
Go ahead!

1207
01:06:58,919 --> 01:07:00,454
Read them all!

1208
01:07:00,888 --> 01:07:04,291
Today, my son left home.

1209
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:09,096
Though obstacles be many,
he will overcome them all!

1210
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:12,099
Take it!
Take it and read it!

1211
01:07:13,834 --> 01:07:17,404
This is what he scribbled
when he was dying!

1212
01:07:17,504 --> 01:07:20,407
"Parvathi says he'll fly.

1213
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:24,611
But I know he won't rest
until he makes everyone fly with him."

1214
01:07:24,745 --> 01:07:28,081
He imagined you reaching great heights!

1215
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:31,351
You broke his heart!

1216
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:34,087
"They say a sparrow can never aspire
to fly high.

1217
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:36,924
But my son will change that!"

1218
01:07:37,024 --> 01:07:38,959
He had so much faith in you.

1219
01:07:39,092 --> 01:07:43,497
You sinner! You failed to understand a man
who understood you so well!

1220
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:49,269
He always said,
"Time is the most valuable asset".

1221
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:53,640
If you can't reach in time,
what's the point of your love or money?

1222
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,775
Why?

1223
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,879
He was hard on you
only for your own good.

1224
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:01,515
Was that wrong?

1225
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:04,484
Is that why you punished him?

1226
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:06,653
He didn't lose!

1227
01:08:07,054 --> 01:08:09,656
When you win,
it is his victory, too.

1228
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,825
I'll never be angry again, Mother.

1229
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,694
I'll never be angry again.

1230
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:18,999
Next three years at the Air Force,
I had just one thought.

1231
01:08:23,003 --> 01:08:24,404
To make the common man fly.

1232
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,317
Why go to the President for this?

1233
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:40,888
I could've done this for you.

1234
01:08:41,655 --> 01:08:43,257
Anyway, all the best.

1235
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:50,931
Move round and round
Like a surging hurricane!

1236
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:54,768
Stomp over arrogance
Like a bull off its leash!

1237
01:08:58,205 --> 01:09:01,842
A streak like the lightning
Tear it all down

1238
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:05,546
Punch it and spread to dry
Then, dust it off and toss it out

1239
01:09:16,023 --> 01:09:17,357
Mr. Balaiyya!

1240
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,395
When aviation is so down,
you're expanding your airlines!

1241
01:09:21,528 --> 01:09:25,132
The new aviation minister says
he'll give no handouts.

1242
01:09:25,232 --> 01:09:26,700
-What do you think?
-Hey Trivedi!

1243
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:28,869
One must take risks to win!

1244
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:30,370
I need no handouts, chump!

1245
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:33,473
My beer company's enough
to bail me out!

1246
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:34,241
Hey, Paresh!

1247
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:36,877
-What is this 'aero show'?
-A flight exhibition, uncle!

1248
01:09:36,977 --> 01:09:38,412
Like our town fair!

1249
01:09:38,545 --> 01:09:41,381
-Is our plane here?
-I'll bring them in from Malaysia!

1250
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:42,749
We got our license!

1251
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:46,053
-Let's go closer!
-When do our planes arrive?

1252
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,189
It'll be here in a week, sir.

1253
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:51,692
Paresh!

1254
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,628
Expanding your flights, huh?

1255
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:57,464
I can't take risks like you, my friend.

1256
01:09:58,398 --> 01:10:00,634
I came to check out turboprops
for cargo.

1257
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,970
Our planes await us at Malaysia.

1258
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:05,839
There's Paresh!

1259
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:08,509
Why did Prakash Babu
bring that halfwit here?

1260
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,411
Teacher and student.

1261
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,347
Oh, so he's that guy!

1262
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:15,549
He looks like a nice chap.

1263
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,152
So obviously, he's doomed!

1264
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,089
Let's sit back and enjoy it!

1265
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,292
You know a bumble bee, Balaiyya?

1266
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:29,196
It's not designed aerodynamically.

1267
01:10:29,796 --> 01:10:33,166
Yet, it flies!

1268
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,501
Do you know why?

1269
01:10:34,835 --> 01:10:38,539
Because it doesn't know that
it can't fly!

1270
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:42,109
Make sure he learns that now.

1271
01:10:47,714 --> 01:10:49,016
Baby, who is it?

1272
01:10:50,884 --> 01:10:52,786
Che says, "Call me".

1273
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,355
-Our planes are leaving, Maha!-What?

1274
01:10:55,489 --> 01:10:57,057
PlaneAm canceled our deal!

1275
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:59,493
They're taking their planes
in three days!

1276
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,794
Why?

1277
01:11:01,195 --> 01:11:04,665
The Indian DGCA is asking them
for Boeing blueprints!

1278
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:06,600
Hundreds of Boeings fly in India!

1279
01:11:07,134 --> 01:11:08,735
No one's asked them for blueprints!

1280
01:11:08,869 --> 01:11:11,004
They told us to check with the government!

1281
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:14,208
PlaneAm's levied a fifty lakh fine
for blocking their flights!

1282
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:16,343
Why is Indian DGCA targeting us?

1283
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,377
Maha?

1284
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:20,681
Pay up, sir!

1285
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:21,815
I'll pay.

1286
01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:46,406
I'll take an auto rickshaw!

1287
01:11:55,048 --> 01:11:58,752
The new by-law was passed last week.

1288
01:11:58,886 --> 01:11:59,786
Didn't you know?

1289
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:01,522
Will Boeing give their blueprints?

1290
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:04,358
Will any company
reveal their trade secrets?

1291
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:06,894
How can you change rules suddenly?

1292
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:08,362
Calm down, Mr. Chandra Mahesh.

1293
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:10,264
Laws can't be changed for you.

1294
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,099
But you will, for the rich, right?

1295
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:17,604
My money's gone.

1296
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:18,639
That's not my problem.

1297
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:20,307
It's your headache.

1298
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:23,177
The DGCA has just done its job.

1299
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,479
-Are you bloody screwing with me!
-Watch your words.

1300
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,915
Why do you want
to start an airline?

1301
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,350
-Go home and graze your cows!
-Mahesh!

1302
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:33,587
Go pimp for Jaz Air!
I can break your damn neck!

1303
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,256
But I'm being patient
and you keep fucking with me?

1304
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,425
Let him go!
Listen to me!

1305
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,267
-Prakash sir.
-Hey, Mahesh.

1306
01:12:47,434 --> 01:12:48,969
I've been trying for days
to see you!

1307
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:50,504
They've changed the laws!

1308
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:53,273
PlaneAm's ending the deal
and demanding a penalty!

1309
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:55,976
We'll lose our planes!
If you could loan me fifty lakhs...

1310
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:59,346
647.38 crores.

1311
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,481
No, sir.
I only asked for fifty lakhs.

1312
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:06,620
Six hundred and forty seven
point thirty eight crores.

1313
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:07,788
Sir?

1314
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,490
That's Mr. Paresh's income

1315
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:15,796
from his travel agency alone
every year.

1316
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:21,768
And you wanted him to join you
and destroy his own business.

1317
01:13:22,102 --> 01:13:23,370
He taught you a lesson.

1318
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,807
You still don't get it?

1319
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:33,046
Paresh is the main angel investor
of SCI.

1320
01:13:34,014 --> 01:13:38,652
Not just SCI, he also controls
people like me in it.

1321
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:40,487
Prakash, come here.

1322
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:44,958
While you came to me
asking for a few lakhs

1323
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:49,329
look how easily he crushed you!

1324
01:13:49,963 --> 01:13:51,331
Yes, that's Paresh.

1325
01:13:52,299 --> 01:13:56,036
By the time you settle your debt,

1326
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:58,272
you'll be finished.

1327
01:13:58,572 --> 01:14:00,407
But your idea?

1328
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:02,242
Fantastic!

1329
01:14:03,043 --> 01:14:04,945
Never occurred to us!

1330
01:14:05,812 --> 01:14:06,647
Check that out!

1331
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:12,719
Your PlaneAm aircraft.

1332
01:14:14,421 --> 01:14:15,088
Mahesh!

1333
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:21,061
We can break and make laws in a day!

1334
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:26,466
He spent just ten minutes
thinking about you

1335
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:29,436
and you're finished!

1336
01:14:30,504 --> 01:14:32,773
Don't make him think anymore, my boy!

1337
01:14:36,376 --> 01:14:37,044
Good luck.

1338
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:29,429
Paresh!

1339
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:32,699
-Where the hell is Paresh?
-Oh, no.

1340
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:35,936
Where is Paresh!

1341
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:37,404
Bloody bastard!

1342
01:15:43,644 --> 01:15:44,311
Paresh!

1343
01:17:07,528 --> 01:17:10,264
Didn't I tell you he would ruin your life?

1344
01:17:10,531 --> 01:17:13,267
How can I relax
with you married to this nut?

1345
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,569
Only God can save him now!

1346
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:19,373
How long will he live off you?
Are you listening to me?

1347
01:17:19,573 --> 01:17:21,675
It's really shameful.

1348
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:25,078
The cow's been mooing all day!
Go check, you moron!

1349
01:17:25,345 --> 01:17:27,181
You don't own a cow.

1350
01:17:27,281 --> 01:17:29,416
She means me, fool!

1351
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,652
Here. I came to give you this.

1352
01:17:31,752 --> 01:17:34,354
An arrogant shrew
with a worthless husband.

1353
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,757
Keep it.

1354
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,293
Take her and leave.

1355
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:41,094
Some daughter, she is. A witch!

1356
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:42,729
Put the cake down.

1357
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,532
What a loser husband. Let's go.

1358
01:17:46,099 --> 01:17:48,101
-Mom, the bags.
-Shut up and come!

1359
01:17:54,474 --> 01:17:55,976
You haven't eaten all day.

1360
01:17:56,577 --> 01:17:59,079
I didn't see you come in.
When did you come?

1361
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:06,520
Maha, Seenu uncle
from next door came by.

1362
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:10,557
His kids want to join a tutorial center
for IAS exams.

1363
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:13,694
He feels you would teach them better.

1364
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:15,662
What do you say?

1365
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:21,435
They're smart kids.

1366
01:18:22,836 --> 01:18:25,639
It'll help you take your mind off this.

1367
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:28,842
Uncle said he'd pay you.

1368
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:31,111
I knew it.

1369
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:33,413
I knew you would eventually get there.

1370
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:35,349
Get where, Maha?

1371
01:18:40,254 --> 01:18:41,121
What is it now?

1372
01:18:41,788 --> 01:18:43,557
Pointing out I'm a freeloader, huh?

1373
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:46,093
Did I say that?

1374
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:49,196
How much did Seenu uncle offer
to help you out?

1375
01:18:50,797 --> 01:18:53,834
Your mom was right about you blabbing
when hungry.

1376
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:58,071
Stop treating me like an idiot!
At least, your mom was direct!

1377
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,774
Why are you fighting with me?

1378
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:03,043
Let's figure out your next move.

1379
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:11,084
Oh, yeah, must figure that out.

1380
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,290
Gee, I wonder why that didn't occur
to this dimwit!

1381
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:25,332
Enlighten me on how to run an airline,
baker girl.

1382
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:26,233
Go ahead.

1383
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:28,702
I'm all ears.

1384
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:33,874
Every time you met investors
with your idea

1385
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:37,110
they laughed at you, didn't they?

1386
01:19:38,011 --> 01:19:40,581
To them, your idea
was just a damn cupcake!

1387
01:19:42,549 --> 01:19:46,787
And what you demean
puts food on our table.

1388
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:51,091
Despite my family's objections,
I married you.

1389
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:54,461
I believed you'd make the poor fly!

1390
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:56,630
Is it all just talk?

1391
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,866
Are you going work
towards it at all!

1392
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,601
Make it happen!

1393
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:04,705
Don't mope around like a loser, Maha!

1394
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,275
Why do you want to live with a loser?

1395
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:10,744
Get lost!

1396
01:20:11,512 --> 01:20:12,446
Go away!

1397
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,148
Achieve something and then get macho!

1398
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,750
Fucking ego!

1399
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,290
My love!

1400
01:21:01,428 --> 01:21:05,766
My love!

1401
01:21:09,837 --> 01:21:13,974
Love of my life!

1402
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:18,212
Baby?

1403
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:21,815
As darkness falls

1404
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:25,252
My heart races

1405
01:21:25,519 --> 01:21:28,488
My eyes are exhausted

1406
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:32,860
From seeking you far and wide

1407
01:21:32,993 --> 01:21:38,999
I yearn to be beside you

1408
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:43,637
I dream of resting

1409
01:21:43,704 --> 01:21:47,107
On your shoulder

1410
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:48,475
My heart calls out for you

1411
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:50,043
Did Baby come here, Seby?

1412
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:51,712
No, Maha.

1413
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:58,352
Only you can take my breath away

1414
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:01,622
And you know it too

1415
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:49,236
My cursed hand

1416
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:51,805
My cursed hand

1417
01:22:51,872 --> 01:22:55,676
I raised against you...

1418
01:22:55,776 --> 01:22:59,947
O forgive me

1419
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:05,285
My anger has faded away

1420
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:08,288
Come back to me

1421
01:23:11,425 --> 01:23:12,626
Where will I go, Maha?

1422
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:15,028
This is my home.

1423
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:17,497
My only home.

1424
01:23:17,598 --> 01:23:21,068
My love

1425
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,074
I looked for you everywhere.

1426
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:29,142
I would have kept you running
for days

1427
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:31,478
if I wasn't pregnant.

1428
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,218
Who breaks such news in this way?

1429
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:41,421
Can't you talk like a normal person?

1430
01:23:42,456 --> 01:23:44,491
I can't. This is who I am.

1431
01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:46,827
And only then,
it gets into your thick skull!

1432
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:01,808
Baby!

1433
01:24:05,846 --> 01:24:06,847
To hell with the net...

1434
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:08,375
Damn sparrows!
Why don't they eat?

1435
01:25:08,675 --> 01:25:12,279
The bigger birds will eat it all
and leave them hungry.

1436
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:17,518
A sparrow is neither too big
nor flies too high.

1437
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:21,655
And so needs very less food.

1438
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:31,565
Baby!

1439
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:33,834
-What is it, Maha?
-Come with me.

1440
01:25:52,352 --> 01:25:53,453
For its size

1441
01:25:54,721 --> 01:25:56,123
and the height it flies...

1442
01:25:57,524 --> 01:25:58,892
it doesn't need much food.

1443
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:02,196
So...

1444
01:26:04,031 --> 01:26:05,899
Not much fuel.

1445
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,135
Small planes!
Turboprops!

1446
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:09,136
Baby!

1447
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:11,271
Small planes need less fuel.

1448
01:26:11,872 --> 01:26:13,540
So tickets can be even cheaper.

1449
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:18,011
I'll convert cargo planes
into passenger ones! A first in India!

1450
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:25,319
Our turboprops are the best in the market.

1451
01:26:25,652 --> 01:26:27,921
But large planes have replaced turboprops
everywhere.

1452
01:26:28,155 --> 01:26:30,624
Your planes are used
only for cargo transport.

1453
01:26:30,757 --> 01:26:33,293
I'll turn your cargos into
passenger planes. Joint venture.

1454
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,629
What is this 'tur-bur' you speak of?

1455
01:26:35,796 --> 01:26:36,997
Turboprops, uncle!

1456
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:40,133
They're like the small Maruti 800 cars.

1457
01:26:40,267 --> 01:26:42,269
They only fly half as high as big planes.

1458
01:26:42,436 --> 01:26:44,805
Fuel cost also gets halved.

1459
01:26:44,938 --> 01:26:46,940
Won't they be cramped?

1460
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:48,775
Yes, the planes are small.

1461
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,378
But they will also get full
with just 70 people.

1462
01:26:51,712 --> 01:26:54,681
Large planes need 200 passengers
to get full.

1463
01:26:54,982 --> 01:26:58,886
Therefore, low costs and high profits.

1464
01:26:58,986 --> 01:27:01,889
You want us to give our planes to you
for free? Why should we?

1465
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:03,857
7,500 trains operate in my country,
every day.

1466
01:27:04,157 --> 01:27:06,360
That's 25 million passengers a day.

1467
01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:09,263
Plus, there are several private
and government bus services.

1468
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:13,800
If just two percent of these people
fly in our airline,

1469
01:27:13,867 --> 01:27:15,536
ours would be a profitable business.

1470
01:27:15,802 --> 01:27:17,738
Can't fly too far with turboprops, sir.

1471
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:20,474
We can't do prestige routes
like Chennai to Delhi.

1472
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:22,042
Must it be a non-stop to Delhi?

1473
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:25,445
Make stops at Vijayawada and Nagpur
and voila!

1474
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:29,783
We cover big cities and small towns.
That's the strength of a sparrow.

1475
01:27:29,883 --> 01:27:32,719
If we share costs with Turboprop company,
in a joint venture

1476
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:34,188
four crores will suffice!

1477
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:37,191
Tea bill of 200 bucks is still due.

1478
01:27:37,324 --> 01:27:40,661
It's about to rain millions
and you're asking for 200 bucks!

1479
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,829
-Get lost!
-Yeah, right!

1480
01:27:42,963 --> 01:27:45,199
You can't even pay 200,
but dreaming of making crores!

1481
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:49,970
I'll take these with me.

1482
01:27:53,674 --> 01:27:55,676
I listened to you
and set up shop here.

1483
01:27:56,043 --> 01:27:58,011
I was worried it wouldn't take off.

1484
01:27:58,345 --> 01:28:01,548
I expected 300-400 bucks tops,
but I make over a 1,000!

1485
01:28:01,815 --> 01:28:02,749
A thousand?

1486
01:28:03,483 --> 01:28:04,184
Per week?

1487
01:28:04,718 --> 01:28:06,153
No!
Per day!

1488
01:28:06,854 --> 01:28:09,790
The college girls across the road
come by every day

1489
01:28:10,257 --> 01:28:13,894
and the boys follow them in
like puppies.

1490
01:28:14,428 --> 01:28:16,363
My shop's in the right place.

1491
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:18,065
Whose idea was that?

1492
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:19,299
Shall we go?

1493
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:21,835
Not bad, Maha.

1494
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:25,339
I thought you were the only one
following girls to bakeries.

1495
01:28:25,539 --> 01:28:27,474
But most boys are, too.

1496
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:29,309
Isn't it time for work?

1497
01:28:29,643 --> 01:28:32,479
Let's eat. I've ordered fritters.
I'm craving for one!

1498
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,414
A coffee, bro.
Lots of sugar.

1499
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,320
-No, thanks.
-What's wrong, Maha?

1500
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:43,991
Paresh isn't in India this month.

1501
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:46,727
We must bring in our planes secretively
before he's back.

1502
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:47,861
How?

1503
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:50,030
Ground work and feasibility reports
are done.

1504
01:28:50,197 --> 01:28:52,232
I even had a meeting
with a French company.

1505
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:55,969
If we do this correctly,
we'll be up and running.

1506
01:28:56,603 --> 01:28:59,039
We don't even need eight crores.
Just four will do.

1507
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:01,542
Why wait? Start.

1508
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,044
We can!

1509
01:29:05,212 --> 01:29:08,081
But only after the company's registered,
can this take off.

1510
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:14,955
Ba-Baby?

1511
01:29:15,722 --> 01:29:17,491
Can you lend me fifteen thousand?

1512
01:29:28,068 --> 01:29:30,571
Is that my coffee?
Lots of sugar?

1513
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:32,339
-For registration...
-Give me the bill.

1514
01:29:33,907 --> 01:29:36,844
Just pay the registration fee.
I can finalize the deal.

1515
01:29:38,111 --> 01:29:39,646
This time, I'll succeed.

1516
01:29:41,315 --> 01:29:42,749
I'll repay you in three months.

1517
01:29:43,917 --> 01:29:46,353
I'll keep accounts.
You keep track of it, too.

1518
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:56,230
Baby...

1519
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:07,774
Good morning, sir.

1520
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:13,013
Maha!

1521
01:30:13,947 --> 01:30:14,982
Never mind 15,000

1522
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,149
I'll give you 20,000.

1523
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:18,452
You talk of doing great things.

1524
01:30:19,019 --> 01:30:20,888
Act accordingly.

1525
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:23,524
Why all this false pride with me?

1526
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:32,199
Sorry.

1527
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:35,402
What?

1528
01:30:36,703 --> 01:30:39,006
Why is it so hard
to ask your wife for help?

1529
01:30:39,339 --> 01:30:40,207
I've said this already!

1530
01:30:40,507 --> 01:30:42,843
My bakery is yours
and your planes are mine.

1531
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,044
Isn't that our deal?

1532
01:31:31,358 --> 01:31:33,560
One tasty sweet for the boss lady.

1533
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:49,343
Bhawar?

1534
01:31:54,815 --> 01:31:55,482
Hey!

1535
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:57,885
-Yes, sir!
-How?

1536
01:31:59,553 --> 01:32:02,222
You're a goddamn pauper.

1537
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:04,725
How can you sleep so peacefully?

1538
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:07,661
Brother, come.

1539
01:32:08,328 --> 01:32:10,764
Something's not right.

1540
01:32:11,098 --> 01:32:12,065
Is there a problem?

1541
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:14,635
Relax, Paresh. All is well.

1542
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:18,038
Just a small glitch with turboprops.
We'll sort it tomorrow. Okay?

1543
01:32:18,172 --> 01:32:20,207
How many times have I told you?

1544
01:32:20,674 --> 01:32:23,043
Good news can wait.

1545
01:32:23,443 --> 01:32:25,345
But problems,
tell me right away.

1546
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,347
The planes we wanted for cargo

1547
01:32:27,481 --> 01:32:29,983
have been taken by someone
as passenger planes.

1548
01:32:30,117 --> 01:32:31,385
Ask Mirza to talk.

1549
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:33,787
And if they do not agree,
make them agree!

1550
01:32:33,921 --> 01:32:37,024
Isn't passenger transport
a better offer for them?

1551
01:32:37,157 --> 01:32:39,126
Pay them more than what we promised.

1552
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:41,762
They're not interested.

1553
01:32:42,362 --> 01:32:43,197
Call Ananth.

1554
01:32:43,463 --> 01:32:44,598
It's 3 AM, Paresh!

1555
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:47,000
So?
I'm awake! Why should he sleep?

1556
01:32:52,806 --> 01:32:53,473
What is this?

1557
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,613
A joint venture
between Turboprop International

1558
01:32:59,713 --> 01:33:01,782
and NCS Aviation Private Limited.

1559
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,853
Registered in the name
of Ms. Sundari.

1560
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:11,158
With Turboprop in the forefront,
he stayed hidden and sealed the deal.

1561
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:13,827
I signed
without a second thought as

1562
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:16,163
only you've been dealing
with turboprops.

1563
01:33:16,396 --> 01:33:17,397
I'm sorry!

1564
01:33:21,168 --> 01:33:22,002
Don't worry, Paresh.

1565
01:33:22,236 --> 01:33:24,338
He's not rich like Balaiyya.

1566
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:25,539
He's just a fool.

1567
01:33:25,672 --> 01:33:27,841
He'll run away
with his tail between his legs.

1568
01:33:28,342 --> 01:33:29,776
Balaiyya's the fool.

1569
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,213
Once his father's wealth is gone,
he'll disappear.

1570
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:37,351
Call up whoever, wherever

1571
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:38,519
but finish him.

1572
01:33:38,652 --> 01:33:39,753
Don't be hasty, Paresh.

1573
01:33:39,887 --> 01:33:42,623
The CBI's still investigating
what we did last time.

1574
01:33:43,056 --> 01:33:44,057
I don't care!

1575
01:33:44,191 --> 01:33:47,127
His plane must not land here.

1576
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:48,295
Okay?

1577
01:33:49,496 --> 01:33:50,163
Okay.

1578
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,832
Damn villager!

1579
01:33:52,032 --> 01:33:53,700
Yes. That's what he is.

1580
01:33:53,901 --> 01:33:55,669
Not him, me.

1581
01:33:56,703 --> 01:34:01,675
India must only speak
of my story from rags to riches!

1582
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:04,678
There has to be only one Paresh.
Right?

1583
01:34:04,912 --> 01:34:07,915
No one knows you here,
buddy!

1584
01:34:08,048 --> 01:34:10,050
But everyone seems to know the witch!

1585
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:11,885
-How are you?
-I'm good!

1586
01:34:12,019 --> 01:34:13,187
How are you, brother?

1587
01:34:13,687 --> 01:34:15,255
I was just praising you.

1588
01:34:15,389 --> 01:34:17,391
-Take care of the bakery, uncle!
-Sure.

1589
01:34:17,524 --> 01:34:19,793
Mock me all you want.
I'll still cook a feast for you.

1590
01:34:19,927 --> 01:34:21,562
-Please come!
-Sure!

1591
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:23,430
My sister's getting married
on the 15th.

1592
01:34:23,564 --> 01:34:24,598
Just a minute.

1593
01:34:25,065 --> 01:34:26,466
-Come here.
-Next month?

1594
01:34:26,633 --> 01:34:27,801
-You can go.
-What's up?

1595
01:34:28,902 --> 01:34:30,437
Money's the problem, right?

1596
01:34:30,904 --> 01:34:31,638
Yes. Why?

1597
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:34,741
Don't worry.
That's no problem at all.

1598
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:35,576
Who much?

1599
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:38,879
I meant 'how much' in English?

1600
01:34:40,581 --> 01:34:42,115
It's okay.
I can handle it.

1601
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:44,117
Why do you hesitate to ask me?

1602
01:34:44,418 --> 01:34:45,085
Just a minute.

1603
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:50,557
Here you go.
Take it, son.

1604
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:51,925
What's the matter?

1605
01:34:56,163 --> 01:35:00,400
11,528 rupees!

1606
01:35:00,934 --> 01:35:04,137
My life savings.

1607
01:35:04,505 --> 01:35:07,107
Take it all and get things going.

1608
01:35:07,407 --> 01:35:08,075
Happy?

1609
01:35:08,609 --> 01:35:12,112
Don't tell Baby about this.
She'll rip me apart.

1610
01:35:12,246 --> 01:35:14,114
-God damn, uncle...
-Quit laughing!

1611
01:35:14,248 --> 01:35:16,250
It's for all of you.
Split it up equally.

1612
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,686
We need three crores
and twenty five lakhs.

1613
01:35:20,654 --> 01:35:25,025
About 2,000 times what you've given us.

1614
01:35:27,027 --> 01:35:28,128
Three crores?

1615
01:35:29,129 --> 01:35:32,099
I don't even know how many zeroes
it has!

1616
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:35,269
This is all I have.

1617
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:37,938
Please don't mistake me.

1618
01:35:39,373 --> 01:35:41,141
Won't this do?

1619
01:35:41,275 --> 01:35:42,176
It's not that, Uncle.

1620
01:35:42,743 --> 01:35:43,844
Uncle!

1621
01:35:45,045 --> 01:35:47,548
Your heart's much bigger
than a mere three crores!

1622
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:51,051
Keep it safe.

1623
01:35:55,522 --> 01:35:56,423
I don't have much...

1624
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:59,059
-Forget about it.
-Uncle is so generous.

1625
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:09,503
Come in.
Good morning.

1626
01:36:09,803 --> 01:36:14,875
As a bank manager, I should've called
the income tax department first.

1627
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:15,676
Sir.

1628
01:36:16,176 --> 01:36:16,944
How much, sir?

1629
01:36:17,544 --> 01:36:18,312
See!

1630
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:22,482
One and a half lakhs. Twenty thousand.
One lakh. Ten thousand. Five hundred.

1631
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:26,553
Your account's been receiving
deposits all day from Tsundur!

1632
01:36:29,823 --> 01:36:31,959
-Can I make a call?
-Yeah. Sure.

1633
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:39,266
Tsundur Post?

1634
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:40,501
Mahesh's on the line.

1635
01:36:40,601 --> 01:36:44,538
I sent two lakhs to your account.
Did you get it?

1636
01:36:44,671 --> 01:36:45,839
Munnuswamy...

1637
01:36:47,508 --> 01:36:48,675
How did you raise so much?

1638
01:36:48,775 --> 01:36:51,612
I pledged my land to Ravi.

1639
01:36:51,745 --> 01:36:53,080
Give me the phone.

1640
01:36:53,213 --> 01:36:55,082
I postponed my sister's wedding a bit!

1641
01:36:55,215 --> 01:36:58,285
The groom will wait
until you repay.

1642
01:36:58,585 --> 01:36:59,953
You keep going.

1643
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:04,591
You should've told me.
Why did you go to that bloodsucking Ravi?

1644
01:37:04,725 --> 01:37:06,426
We can't be bystanders

1645
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:09,897
and see you work hard
to make our lives better.

1646
01:37:11,064 --> 01:37:15,903
It's because you stopped the train,
our land prices have skyrocketed.

1647
01:37:16,036 --> 01:37:17,604
-Let me speak to Mahesh!
-Go on!

1648
01:37:17,738 --> 01:37:21,775
I sold all my paddy and sent
eight thousand rupees. Did you get it?

1649
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:23,143
-Hold on!
-I did.

1650
01:37:23,277 --> 01:37:24,745
-Yes, he got it.
-Give it to him.

1651
01:37:24,878 --> 01:37:26,213
-Here you go.
-Pipe down.

1652
01:37:26,313 --> 01:37:28,282
Maha, my boy...

1653
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:29,917
Grandpa...

1654
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:32,619
I just planted chilies
as there were no rains.

1655
01:37:32,753 --> 01:37:35,088
I could only send 500 rupees.
Did you get it?

1656
01:37:35,822 --> 01:37:37,491
You're struggling without rain.

1657
01:37:39,259 --> 01:37:40,227
Why all this?

1658
01:37:40,327 --> 01:37:42,262
This kid wants to talk to you!

1659
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:45,332
Talk to him. Here you go.

1660
01:37:45,465 --> 01:37:46,633
-Hello?
-Talk to him.

1661
01:37:47,234 --> 01:37:48,669
How are you, uncle?

1662
01:37:48,735 --> 01:37:51,138
Did you get my money?

1663
01:37:51,405 --> 01:37:52,573
How did you get so much?

1664
01:37:52,673 --> 01:37:55,142
From my piggy bank.

1665
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:58,145
Take me in your airplanes, too.

1666
01:37:58,278 --> 01:38:02,516
The neighboring towns have donated.
Make your donations right away, residents.

1667
01:38:02,649 --> 01:38:05,352
Stand in line.
Don't cut in.

1668
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:09,523
Thirty seven thousand. Twelve thousand.
Forty thousand. Thirty one thousand.

1669
01:38:09,656 --> 01:38:11,491
Look properly. It's thirty-one lakhs.

1670
01:38:11,959 --> 01:38:13,227
Thirty-one lakhs?

1671
01:38:13,927 --> 01:38:18,198
Get the airplanes here real soon, my boy!

1672
01:38:18,465 --> 01:38:22,002
I will fly all our people
to my daughter's wedding.

1673
01:38:22,135 --> 01:38:24,605
No, sir.
Let's first get back your lands from Ravi.

1674
01:38:24,705 --> 01:38:26,340
I'll come talk to him myself.

1675
01:38:26,473 --> 01:38:27,641
Maha...

1676
01:38:27,774 --> 01:38:28,442
Mom?

1677
01:38:28,509 --> 01:38:30,377
If you're the teacher's son,
I'm his wife!

1678
01:38:30,511 --> 01:38:33,847
I demanded the documents back
from Ravi.

1679
01:38:33,981 --> 01:38:36,350
He told us to pay up
six months' interest anyway.

1680
01:38:36,483 --> 01:38:38,519
No one can touch us
if we're united.

1681
01:38:38,652 --> 01:38:41,121
Victory or defeat,
it's all in your hands now.

1682
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:43,991
You'll win, right?

1683
01:38:44,124 --> 01:38:46,527
Your father's always with you.

1684
01:38:46,894 --> 01:38:49,162
We're all praying for you, son.

1685
01:38:49,663 --> 01:38:50,364
Win!

1686
01:38:50,597 --> 01:38:52,733
We're counting on you.

1687
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:54,434
Win!

1688
01:38:54,968 --> 01:38:56,470
Victory is yours.

1689
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:58,071
-Shall I hang up?
-Okay, Mom.

1690
01:39:01,408 --> 01:39:03,877
All major airports
are under Paresh's control.

1691
01:39:04,011 --> 01:39:06,680
-You'll land your plane on this airstrip?
-Yes.

1692
01:39:07,014 --> 01:39:08,415
Built in the British era.

1693
01:39:08,549 --> 01:39:11,485
Airstrips for postal delivery
and diplomatic trips.

1694
01:39:11,585 --> 01:39:13,086
People like Nehru have been here.

1695
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,688
Abandoned unused airstrips?

1696
01:39:15,222 --> 01:39:17,090
How many? Three or four?

1697
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:17,891
500!

1698
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:20,060
500 of these exist across India.

1699
01:39:20,194 --> 01:39:21,862
We'll prep them for our planes to land!

1700
01:39:21,995 --> 01:39:26,333
Spark the coal
Which lies within your core!

1701
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:30,938
Light up your future
With the flames that abound

1702
01:39:31,071 --> 01:39:35,442
Ignore the tornadoes
That stand in your way

1703
01:39:35,576 --> 01:39:40,247
Move forward
And fulfill your dreams

1704
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,852
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

1705
01:39:44,952 --> 01:39:49,423
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

1706
01:39:49,556 --> 01:39:53,961
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

1707
01:39:54,094 --> 01:39:58,599
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

1708
01:39:58,732 --> 01:40:03,070
Tear to shreds, all that obstructs

1709
01:40:03,303 --> 01:40:07,774
Give wings to dreams that trust in you
And soar

1710
01:40:09,977 --> 01:40:11,879
What are you saying, Seby?
Be clear.

1711
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:14,748
For the first time, Indians can book
plane tickets with credit cards.

1712
01:40:15,048 --> 01:40:17,150
How many Indians have credit cards?

1713
01:40:17,284 --> 01:40:19,453
They all have telephones, right?
That is enough!

1714
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,890
They can call our call center
and book tickets.

1715
01:40:23,223 --> 01:40:27,094
With a PNR number, they pick up tickets
at their bank or supermarket.

1716
01:40:29,429 --> 01:40:30,430
But...

1717
01:40:31,098 --> 01:40:33,634
We are trying this
with publicly owned computers.

1718
01:40:34,067 --> 01:40:37,771
Interworld spends six months
just testing this software!

1719
01:40:37,905 --> 01:40:39,840
-Yeah.
-We don't have that kind of luxury.

1720
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,975
No one else has tried this here.

1721
01:40:42,209 --> 01:40:43,610
This will be the first time in India.

1722
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,682
You want to sell your tickets
at the railway counter?

1723
01:40:48,815 --> 01:40:51,919
Why will I agree to take away
my business?

1724
01:40:52,019 --> 01:40:55,455
Every day, there are 10,000 people
in the waiting list for A/C coaches.

1725
01:40:55,589 --> 01:40:57,491
I'll take only those people in my airline.

1726
01:40:57,624 --> 01:41:01,428
Just give me a small space
next to your reservation counter.

1727
01:41:01,628 --> 01:41:03,330
Bottom line is,
they need to travel, right?

1728
01:41:03,463 --> 01:41:07,100
Okay. It's a great idea!
All the very best, Mr. Mahesh.

1729
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:25,652
Why should victory reach you
When you summon it with a snap?

1730
01:41:25,953 --> 01:41:30,224
How will one understand the difference
Between you and anyone else?

1731
01:41:30,357 --> 01:41:34,828
You need a story, too
Narrate it with pride

1732
01:41:34,962 --> 01:41:39,433
The sweat of your effort
Shall bloom with the fragrance of victory

1733
01:41:39,833 --> 01:41:44,338
Our eyes may be small
But not our dreams

1734
01:41:44,404 --> 01:41:48,842
Let not your limitations
Draw your boundaries

1735
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:49,676
BISMI MOBILES
SALES & SERVICES

1736
01:41:49,776 --> 01:41:53,514
We won't be born again
After we're one with the earth

1737
01:41:53,847 --> 01:41:55,148
-A call for you.
-What is it called?

1738
01:41:55,249 --> 01:41:57,618
The company's called Deccan Air.
Do you like it?

1739
01:41:58,585 --> 01:41:59,987
-He isn't fit.
-Is he?

1740
01:42:00,087 --> 01:42:02,155
You bugger off.
You come in!

1741
01:42:02,256 --> 01:42:06,493
Write a brand new story,
as your life changes today!

1742
01:42:06,593 --> 01:42:08,362
Deccan Air won't get pilots.

1743
01:42:08,495 --> 01:42:10,531
We paid them three times more
than he did.

1744
01:42:10,664 --> 01:42:11,665
They took it!

1745
01:42:11,765 --> 01:42:15,235
Dismiss all of them next month.

1746
01:42:15,402 --> 01:42:16,069
Brother?

1747
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:18,705
If I can buy them,
anybody can buy them.

1748
01:42:20,374 --> 01:42:21,408
-Stop it!
-Maha's here!

1749
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:23,510
The pilots didn't show up!

1750
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:25,212
-Seby!
-Where's he off to?

1751
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:26,613
-Wait, I'll tell you!
-Do you get anything he does?

1752
01:42:26,747 --> 01:42:28,782
Where are you going?
None of our pilots came!

1753
01:42:37,224 --> 01:42:39,660
A guy who can buy a government
can buy anyone.

1754
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:41,228
There are our pilots.

1755
01:42:41,361 --> 01:42:43,964
Retired military aviators
who flew fighter jets for India.

1756
01:42:44,097 --> 01:42:46,300
Retired Pilots?
There is an age limit!

1757
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:52,806
Let me in on the joke!

1758
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,775
Air Force pilots retire at 57.

1759
01:42:54,908 --> 01:42:56,210
Civilian pilots at 61.

1760
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:57,878
They can fly for another four years!

1761
01:42:57,978 --> 01:43:00,047
Kickass!
Two can play this game!

1762
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,748
You've upheld Guntur's pride!

1763
01:43:01,882 --> 01:43:04,418
Captain Rajiv Manohar,
coordinated all this.

1764
01:43:04,551 --> 01:43:05,786
Retired as Air Commodore.

1765
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:25,639
I don't believe this.
Is this how it is done!

1766
01:43:25,772 --> 01:43:28,108
-We need to focus on the airline, uncle!
-Yes, yes!

1767
01:43:42,155 --> 01:43:44,124
-I've been waiting for you.
-Bored at work?

1768
01:43:44,258 --> 01:43:45,993
I have a proposal for you.

1769
01:43:46,126 --> 01:43:47,127
What proposal?

1770
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:48,328
A business proposal!

1771
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:50,063
What business?

1772
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:52,466
Do you do this to all your vendors?

1773
01:43:55,369 --> 01:44:00,274
Let my catering division
take care of your in-flight snacks.

1774
01:44:00,974 --> 01:44:03,644
Logistically impossible
with just one outlet in Madras.

1775
01:44:03,777 --> 01:44:04,578
It is possible!

1776
01:44:05,112 --> 01:44:06,847
Who told you Madras was my only base?

1777
01:44:07,114 --> 01:44:08,248
I have franchises!

1778
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:12,452
Che's family in Vijayawada.
My brother in Vizakh.

1779
01:44:12,553 --> 01:44:14,354
Projected monthly turnover's ten lakhs!

1780
01:44:14,655 --> 01:44:17,491
That's 1.2 crores per year!

1781
01:44:20,294 --> 01:44:23,263
Welcome to Deccan Air,
Mrs. Sundari Kanayanam!

1782
01:44:23,697 --> 01:44:26,466
Don't expect any special treatment.
Alright?

1783
01:44:26,834 --> 01:44:29,770
You too, don't expect any discounts.
Deal.

1784
01:44:32,706 --> 01:44:34,074
We're talking business!

1785
01:44:34,341 --> 01:44:35,509
Business is done, right?

1786
01:44:37,711 --> 01:44:38,946
It's coming!

1787
01:44:40,747 --> 01:44:42,316
What's this?
I don't get it!

1788
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:43,851
Like we get anything you say!

1789
01:44:43,984 --> 01:44:46,220
When our planes land
for the first time

1790
01:44:46,353 --> 01:44:49,389
it would be auspicious
to land facing east!

1791
01:44:49,523 --> 01:44:51,525
You won't get it!
Back off!

1792
01:44:51,658 --> 01:44:55,529
No! They'll land
only as per the designated coordinates!

1793
01:44:55,662 --> 01:44:56,997
There you go again!

1794
01:44:57,097 --> 01:44:58,932
Never clear!

1795
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,467
That's ours, right?

1796
01:45:00,767 --> 01:45:02,870
Look, uncle!
Our plane's coming!

1797
01:45:03,437 --> 01:45:05,339
Chennai Tower, this is Deccan Air 582.

1798
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:07,441
Minimum fuel.
Requesting landing clearance.

1799
01:45:07,508 --> 01:45:09,776
Go around, Deccan Air 582.

1800
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:12,579
Where are the other two planes?

1801
01:45:12,713 --> 01:45:15,282
Is that why you brought three garlands?
Others will be here in two days.

1802
01:45:17,718 --> 01:45:19,253
Why aren't they landing?

1803
01:45:19,386 --> 01:45:20,754
They are not getting permission to land?

1804
01:45:20,888 --> 01:45:22,789
Is there a problem with
DA-582's landing?

1805
01:45:22,923 --> 01:45:25,425
It's huge!
Garlands are small, damn!

1806
01:45:25,592 --> 01:45:27,027
How long will they circle around?

1807
01:45:27,127 --> 01:45:28,962
Get to the ATC, boys!
I'll handle the ground operation!

1808
01:45:29,029 --> 01:45:30,430
-Seby, come with me.
-Go!

1809
01:45:30,898 --> 01:45:32,633
-I need to go too, uncle!
-Where are you going?

1810
01:45:32,766 --> 01:45:34,801
-Let go! Why is he running?
-Don't run!

1811
01:45:34,935 --> 01:45:36,870
I said we have a fuel emergency,
goddammit!

1812
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:39,973
I say again.
Deccan Air 582. Go around.

1813
01:45:40,107 --> 01:45:42,342
There is something's wrong, Captain.
They're ignoring protocol.

1814
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:44,144
Chennai Tower,
requesting reason for denial!

1815
01:45:44,478 --> 01:45:47,915
I say this again.
Go around, Deccan Air 582!

1816
01:45:48,749 --> 01:45:49,416
Paresh.

1817
01:45:49,883 --> 01:45:51,051
This is highly risky.

1818
01:45:51,151 --> 01:45:53,487
If we delay any further,
the plane is going to crash.

1819
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:55,389
You said you just wanted to scare them!

1820
01:45:55,489 --> 01:45:58,258
You're using civil aviation property!

1821
01:45:58,392 --> 01:46:00,627
I'll be the one investigated!

1822
01:46:00,761 --> 01:46:01,495
How dare you?

1823
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:07,000
You are not dumb enough

1824
01:46:07,067 --> 01:46:10,437
to piss off the man who put you
in the DGCA.

1825
01:46:10,504 --> 01:46:11,171
Right?

1826
01:46:12,773 --> 01:46:14,241
You owe me, my friend!

1827
01:46:14,474 --> 01:46:17,678
Paresh, we'll be in trouble,
if this flight crashes.

1828
01:46:18,946 --> 01:46:19,680
Che!

1829
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:21,348
Tambaram Air Force.
Runway 1-5.

1830
01:46:21,481 --> 01:46:23,617
Land there!
Do you have enough fuel for that?

1831
01:46:23,684 --> 01:46:24,651
I'll take care of it.

1832
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:25,853
Switch to company frequency!

1833
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,921
Who do you think you are?

1834
01:46:28,422 --> 01:46:29,590
I own that fucking plane!

1835
01:46:31,725 --> 01:46:33,227
Guards, take him out.

1836
01:46:34,127 --> 01:46:35,762
Security breach at gate one!

1837
01:46:35,863 --> 01:46:38,599
Che, listen, if the fuel is low,
switch to auxiliary engines!

1838
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:41,268
Don't teach me how to do my job!

1839
01:46:41,368 --> 01:46:45,339
My dad warned me not to hang out with you.
I should've listened!

1840
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:47,641
Anything happens to me,
tell Preethi I love her.

1841
01:46:47,774 --> 01:46:50,444
I'll tell that Brigadier's daughter, too!

1842
01:46:51,044 --> 01:46:52,646
Get our plane home safe, man!

1843
01:47:00,587 --> 01:47:01,255
Che!

1844
01:47:08,395 --> 01:47:09,396
Come in, Che!

1845
01:47:10,697 --> 01:47:11,365
Che!

1846
01:47:12,232 --> 01:47:12,900
Get help!

1847
01:47:14,034 --> 01:47:16,803
-Open the emergency hatch! Hurry!
-He's fine, right?

1848
01:47:20,874 --> 01:47:23,310
We are ex Air Force!
There are two pilots inside!

1849
01:47:23,911 --> 01:47:24,811
They need some help!

1850
01:47:26,647 --> 01:47:27,481
Batch of '87!

1851
01:47:28,315 --> 01:47:29,216
We need some help!

1852
01:47:30,484 --> 01:47:32,386
Two pilots are trapped inside!
Please help them.

1853
01:47:32,519 --> 01:47:34,688
Please help them!
It's an emergency!

1854
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:44,598
Che!

1855
01:47:45,132 --> 01:47:45,933
Are you okay?

1856
01:47:46,366 --> 01:47:47,034
Are you okay?

1857
01:47:56,577 --> 01:47:57,244
Jai Hind, sir!

1858
01:48:12,626 --> 01:48:15,696
Why didn't you declare Mayday
and land at the Airport?

1859
01:48:15,796 --> 01:48:20,534
If we had, they would've impounded
my flights for months!

1860
01:48:20,634 --> 01:48:23,003
My launch is on August 25th.
And it must happen!

1861
01:48:23,303 --> 01:48:24,238
Excuse me, sir.

1862
01:48:24,538 --> 01:48:26,039
Jai Hind, sir.
Call for you, sir.

1863
01:48:26,139 --> 01:48:29,042
The airport authorities want an update
for the press!

1864
01:48:38,418 --> 01:48:41,822
Three years ago, a Saudia Air Boeing
made an emergency landing.

1865
01:48:42,389 --> 01:48:44,157
On this very airstrip!

1866
01:48:44,291 --> 01:48:45,959
-Remember, Chaitanya?
-Sir.

1867
01:48:46,827 --> 01:48:48,228
What did we do?

1868
01:48:48,328 --> 01:48:50,464
We investigated for terrorist links.

1869
01:48:50,998 --> 01:48:52,499
And then we levied a five crore fine.

1870
01:48:53,066 --> 01:48:56,270
You three will get a ten-year prison term
along with the fine.

1871
01:49:02,809 --> 01:49:04,711
You haven't even taken off

1872
01:49:05,812 --> 01:49:08,115
and you already have enemies
all the way to Delhi!

1873
01:49:11,018 --> 01:49:11,718
We're done here.

1874
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:16,089
They aren't terrorists!

1875
01:49:16,623 --> 01:49:18,292
Tell them
I'm letting them go!

1876
01:49:18,825 --> 01:49:19,860
They'll pay a fine!

1877
01:49:20,661 --> 01:49:22,196
-Dismiss!
-Jai Hind, sir!

1878
01:49:24,298 --> 01:49:25,532
You will pay a fine!

1879
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,268
For the unauthorized landing
at our base

1880
01:49:28,602 --> 01:49:29,469
it's 25,000!

1881
01:49:31,038 --> 01:49:33,440
You can pay three months after
you start your airline.

1882
01:49:37,177 --> 01:49:38,378
What are you waiting for?

1883
01:49:38,512 --> 01:49:40,414
A hug and a sendoff ceremony?

1884
01:49:40,948 --> 01:49:41,615
Go.

1885
01:49:42,716 --> 01:49:43,951
-Out!
-Sir!

1886
01:49:48,856 --> 01:49:51,525
They'll target you for letting me go.

1887
01:49:53,193 --> 01:49:55,028
Do I look scared?

1888
01:49:55,128 --> 01:49:57,631
You've never liked me, sir.

1889
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:00,834
Maha!

1890
01:50:01,969 --> 01:50:03,670
If I had not punished you
back then

1891
01:50:04,471 --> 01:50:09,476
my cadets wouldn't have respected me.

1892
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:11,712
And if I bow to political pressure now

1893
01:50:11,845 --> 01:50:13,614
I won't respect myself.

1894
01:50:13,914 --> 01:50:14,681
Brother...

1895
01:50:15,516 --> 01:50:17,484
What you intend to do

1896
01:50:18,485 --> 01:50:22,756
is much bigger
than either of our egos.

1897
01:50:24,558 --> 01:50:29,129
A soldier must ensure
to bring every trooper home.

1898
01:50:29,696 --> 01:50:30,998
Like you did today.

1899
01:50:32,065 --> 01:50:33,133
You are a leader today.

1900
01:50:34,535 --> 01:50:35,769
Leader.

1901
01:50:41,175 --> 01:50:42,109
I don't smoke.

1902
01:50:43,343 --> 01:50:45,579
You shouldn't either.
You're getting old, right?

1903
01:50:45,879 --> 01:50:46,547
Hey!

1904
01:50:47,447 --> 01:50:49,149
Don't you dare call me old!

1905
01:50:50,284 --> 01:50:52,953
Get out before I change my mind.

1906
01:50:53,787 --> 01:50:54,755
Get lost!

1907
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:56,323
Thank you, sir.

1908
01:51:07,935 --> 01:51:10,470
Mr. Mahesh!
Ready to fly, huh?

1909
01:51:12,306 --> 01:51:14,741
Are you inviting the minister?
Good, good!

1910
01:51:16,076 --> 01:51:17,744
Need a recommendation?

1911
01:51:20,881 --> 01:51:23,150
Do you know Tata?
Ratan Tata?

1912
01:51:25,152 --> 01:51:27,721
He himself couldn't start an airline here.

1913
01:51:28,589 --> 01:51:31,558
Poor guy tried for 20 years!

1914
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:33,660
-Twenty years...
-You think you can scare me?

1915
01:51:34,428 --> 01:51:36,496
Going on and on
about Ratan Tata!

1916
01:51:36,997 --> 01:51:37,698
I'm not Ratan Tata!

1917
01:51:37,965 --> 01:51:38,632
You bloody...

1918
01:51:38,999 --> 01:51:40,400
People trust me.
That will do.

1919
01:51:41,034 --> 01:51:41,735
Ah, the crowds!

1920
01:51:42,669 --> 01:51:43,570
Public opinion?

1921
01:51:44,571 --> 01:51:46,206
That changes every week!

1922
01:51:47,074 --> 01:51:49,576
Be careful, Mr. Mahesh.

1923
01:51:50,577 --> 01:51:51,245
Excuse me.

1924
01:51:52,346 --> 01:51:53,680
I have an airline to run, my friend.

1925
01:51:54,681 --> 01:51:56,483
It's my time now!

1926
01:52:01,622 --> 01:52:02,823
The people are with him.

1927
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:05,759
You keep swatting at that bee,
but it keeps flying.

1928
01:52:07,494 --> 01:52:08,161
Murthy?

1929
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:10,898
-Murthy!
-Sir.

1930
01:52:11,465 --> 01:52:12,165
It's Mallesham, sir.

1931
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:13,800
Right, Mallesham!

1932
01:52:14,768 --> 01:52:15,569
Mallesham...

1933
01:52:16,703 --> 01:52:18,705
Do you know Chandra Mahesh Kanayanam?

1934
01:52:19,773 --> 01:52:20,440
I do, sir.

1935
01:52:21,375 --> 01:52:22,075
What do you know?

1936
01:52:22,776 --> 01:52:25,179
I heard he's offering
plane tickets at low price.

1937
01:52:25,712 --> 01:52:27,548
You'll make people fly
for just one rupee?

1938
01:52:28,015 --> 01:52:28,782
Impossible!

1939
01:52:29,149 --> 01:52:31,151
Today, 75% of flights fly half-empty!

1940
01:52:31,285 --> 01:52:32,920
I'll charge a rupee
for each empty seat.

1941
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,356
Just a rupee for those who book
much in advance.

1942
01:52:37,124 --> 01:52:39,660
Once those are booked,
500 rupee seats open up!

1943
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,028
Then, the 1,000s!

1944
01:52:41,161 --> 01:52:44,531
But aren't you deceiving people
by giving just ten one rupee tickets?

1945
01:52:44,665 --> 01:52:47,234
Three planes.
Ten trips each per day.

1946
01:52:47,367 --> 01:52:50,504
That is 300 people will fly at one rupee,
per day.

1947
01:52:50,704 --> 01:52:53,674
And even our most expensive ticket
costs the same as an A/C train ticket.

1948
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:55,442
Will you fly in that plane?

1949
01:52:55,909 --> 01:52:57,344
I don't know if I will, sir.

1950
01:52:58,212 --> 01:53:02,182
But I want my mother to fly
at least once.

1951
01:53:03,383 --> 01:53:04,952
She'll be very happy.

1952
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,889
There are two unused airstrips
in your region.

1953
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:13,427
Imagine the impact
when these planes land there!

1954
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:19,833
So my servant will fly with me
as an equal?

1955
01:53:19,933 --> 01:53:21,568
And I'm supposed to let that happen?

1956
01:53:21,702 --> 01:53:23,003
His investment.

1957
01:53:24,004 --> 01:53:25,339
That must be destroyed first.

1958
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:28,242
We're proud to cover
the launch of this airline

1959
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:32,012
that could be a significant milestone
in the history of Indian aviation!

1960
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:36,083
Even a cup of tea costs more than a rupee.
But Maha's making people fly for a rupee!

1961
01:53:36,216 --> 01:53:39,419
I hereby announce two airstrips
will be operated in my region alone!

1962
01:53:39,553 --> 01:53:43,857
I've always been a visionary.
We must encourage the youth of our nation.

1963
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:45,926
I hereby declare Deccan Air launched!

1964
01:53:53,567 --> 01:53:55,035
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

1965
01:53:55,135 --> 01:53:57,538
you're welcome onboard,
Deccan Air maiden flight.

1966
01:54:00,941 --> 01:54:03,477
We're now ready for departure.
Enjoy our services. Thank you.

1967
01:54:25,332 --> 01:54:27,267
Deccan Air 582
ready for departure.

1968
01:54:27,501 --> 01:54:29,837
Line up and clear for take-off.
Wind calm.

1969
01:54:47,287 --> 01:54:48,789
-Fire! Get up!
-Go! Go!

1970
01:54:51,258 --> 01:54:53,093
Please sit!

1971
01:54:59,633 --> 01:55:01,034
What's going on?
Look!

1972
01:55:01,902 --> 01:55:03,403
Please sit down!

1973
01:55:05,472 --> 01:55:06,807
There's smoke in engine one!

1974
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:08,675
Stay calm!

1975
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:11,278
Mahesh, where are you going?

1976
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:13,347
Please stay calm!

1977
01:55:13,447 --> 01:55:14,314
Captain!

1978
01:55:14,948 --> 01:55:15,983
Captain, smoke.

1979
01:55:17,251 --> 01:55:18,252
Captain, smoke.

1980
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:20,020
Captain, smoke.!
Abort!

1981
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,622
Captain! Captain!

1982
01:55:22,055 --> 01:55:24,691
Reject take-off!
Power lever idle! Shut down engines!

1983
01:55:27,961 --> 01:55:29,663
Captain, come on!
Apply brakes, Captain!

1984
01:55:35,035 --> 01:55:36,537
Applying maximum brakes!

1985
01:55:58,358 --> 01:56:01,762
Deccan Air 582 to Chennai Tower!
Mayday, Mayday! Engine is smoking!

1986
01:56:01,895 --> 01:56:03,864
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!

1987
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:07,067
Evacuate! Go! Go!

1988
01:56:09,903 --> 01:56:10,904
Come along, sir!

1989
01:56:11,004 --> 01:56:12,239
Mahesh, what is this?

1990
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,708
Steer clear of the aircraft!

1991
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:16,710
Stay back!
Move away! Sir!

1992
01:56:19,746 --> 01:56:22,182
Relax, sir. Please wait in the lounge.
I'll set things right.

1993
01:56:22,316 --> 01:56:23,550
How much longer, Che?

1994
01:56:23,684 --> 01:56:25,385
Forty five minutes!
Just give me some time.

1995
01:56:25,619 --> 01:56:27,020
Sir, relax. Nothing to panic, sir.

1996
01:56:27,387 --> 01:56:29,056
This is a failure, man!
Drive!

1997
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:31,725
-Sir! Please don't say that!
-Drive!

1998
01:56:32,326 --> 01:56:34,294
Sir!
Please, sir!

1999
01:56:38,532 --> 01:56:40,968
His problem is he aims too high!

2000
01:56:41,235 --> 01:56:44,738
Rush into things, and this happens!
You put our village to shame!

2001
01:56:44,872 --> 01:56:47,608
-Shut up, dad!
-You shut up!

2002
01:56:57,518 --> 01:56:58,819
Guys! Guys!
Mahesh is here.

2003
01:56:59,119 --> 01:56:59,887
Come on, come on.

2004
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,390
Mr. Mahesh, is it true
you disregarded safety regulations?

2005
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:04,491
Answer us!

2006
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:06,426
Your very first trip ended in disaster!

2007
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,128
Your cheap tickets
will claim lives!

2008
01:57:08,262 --> 01:57:09,162
It was not intentional!

2009
01:57:09,229 --> 01:57:12,165
-Did you not follow safety regulations?
-We have!

2010
01:57:12,299 --> 01:57:15,669
Answer us, sir!
People deserve the truth!

2011
01:57:15,802 --> 01:57:18,906
-Why have you gone silent?
-Answer us!

2012
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,241
Speak up!

2013
01:57:21,341 --> 01:57:24,912
Is human life worth so little to you?

2014
01:57:27,281 --> 01:57:29,283
Is a life worth so little?

2015
01:57:29,483 --> 01:57:30,317
I'm explaining that.

2016
01:57:46,466 --> 01:57:48,101
I'll handle this!

2017
01:57:48,202 --> 01:57:49,203
You handle them!

2018
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:50,971
Let's go, uncle!

2019
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:55,542
Come along, uncle!

2020
01:57:55,676 --> 01:57:56,610
We can go.

2021
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:09,356
Is it true you did not follow
safety regulations? Answer us!

2022
01:58:09,723 --> 01:58:13,694
As per international regulations,
we did safety checks in India and France!

2023
01:58:14,294 --> 01:58:17,197
Our goal was low-priced airlines.
Not undermining security.

2024
01:58:17,331 --> 01:58:20,701
India has so many basic issues!
Is flying a necessity?

2025
01:58:20,834 --> 01:58:23,136
Every benefit must reach everyone!
And they will!

2026
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:26,273
This is my domain.
And I want to break the barriers here!

2027
01:58:26,373 --> 01:58:27,107
Is it wrong?

2028
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:28,976
Such philosophies only sound good.

2029
01:58:29,042 --> 01:58:31,345
I am telling you!
Hear me out!

2030
01:58:31,478 --> 01:58:34,648
We did all due diligence!
No rules were violated!

2031
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,555
People are not about to get into
one of these flights in a hurry.

2032
01:58:41,889 --> 01:58:47,427
People will not fly Deccan Air again.
This may well be their last flight.

2033
01:59:27,935 --> 01:59:29,469
The teacher is back!

2034
02:00:03,437 --> 02:00:06,139
Are we contesting elections?
Good enough if people fly.

2035
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:09,076
So shall we issue a CRS?

2036
02:00:10,978 --> 02:00:12,346
Yeah. Go check!

2037
02:00:14,448 --> 02:00:16,149
Has the oil been uplifted, Che?

2038
02:00:18,085 --> 02:00:20,087
They've assigned Bay 64 to us.

2039
02:00:26,693 --> 02:00:27,761
Mr. Rajiv Manohar,

2040
02:00:28,495 --> 02:00:31,365
your statement says that
Deccan Air violated many safety rules.

2041
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:32,799
Can you elaborate?

2042
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:36,003
What crimes did Deccan Air commit?
Tell us.

2043
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:39,606
Is it true that Deccan Air
was indifferent?

2044
02:00:44,945 --> 02:00:45,612
No, sir.

2045
02:00:46,813 --> 02:00:48,248
This is all my fault.

2046
02:00:50,184 --> 02:00:53,020
What's this, sir?
He keeps changing his statement!

2047
02:00:53,153 --> 02:00:56,557
Did someone force you
to sabotage Deccan Air's flight?

2048
02:00:57,024 --> 02:01:00,561
I was negligent during fueling.

2049
02:01:00,694 --> 02:01:02,596
I didn't do my safety checks properly.

2050
02:01:02,996 --> 02:01:04,364
It's my fault.

2051
02:01:05,065 --> 02:01:06,333
Is someone threatening you?

2052
02:01:06,633 --> 02:01:09,036
We all know who is threatening whom.

2053
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:12,406
Explain that, Mr. Manohar.

2054
02:01:12,906 --> 02:01:13,974
Who is threatening you?

2055
02:01:14,308 --> 02:01:15,309
Let it go.

2056
02:01:16,476 --> 02:01:18,846
I'm satisfied with his statement.
It's okay.

2057
02:01:19,246 --> 02:01:21,248
Deccan Air's not at fault.

2058
02:01:21,515 --> 02:01:23,083
File the report as 'Pilot Negligence'.

2059
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,352
It was not a technical failure.

2060
02:01:25,485 --> 02:01:27,421
Deccan Air is cleared of all charges.

2061
02:01:34,828 --> 02:01:35,896
I trusted you, Captain.

2062
02:01:36,864 --> 02:01:41,034
I have many problems at home.

2063
02:01:41,201 --> 02:01:41,869
Worse than mine?

2064
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:46,039
They'll try to buy us, sir.

2065
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:48,709
Saying no is our only strength!

2066
02:01:48,842 --> 02:01:49,643
But I...

2067
02:01:50,644 --> 02:01:52,079
I won't ask you to leave.

2068
02:01:56,617 --> 02:01:58,719
What are you doing, Maha?
Why did you let him off?

2069
02:01:59,653 --> 02:02:00,754
He's my father's age, Che.

2070
02:02:05,726 --> 02:02:10,030
Monday 9 pm, an exclusive interview
with Paresh Goswami!

2071
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:10,964
-Live!
-Maha?

2072
02:02:11,465 --> 02:02:13,600
Why won't you pick up the phone
or charge the damn thing?

2073
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:17,070
Balaiyya PA trying to contact you.
They want to meet you tomorrow!

2074
02:02:18,071 --> 02:02:18,872
I'm not going.

2075
02:02:19,239 --> 02:02:20,874
It could be useful to us.

2076
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:23,210
I don't want his help!

2077
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:25,612
The shape we're in,
we need all the help we can get!

2078
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:28,815
I'll not deal with his kind anymore.

2079
02:02:31,818 --> 02:02:33,554
I'm taking the evening bus home.

2080
02:02:34,821 --> 02:02:36,657
You just got here this morning.

2081
02:02:37,124 --> 02:02:38,225
Stay here for a couple of days.

2082
02:02:39,092 --> 02:02:41,395
No, buddy,
I just came by to see you.

2083
02:02:42,396 --> 02:02:45,899
My sister's fiance's family
is asking for a wedding date.

2084
02:02:47,067 --> 02:02:49,636
Don't stress.
Whenever you say!

2085
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:53,073
Just indicate a date,
and I'll manage the rest.

2086
02:02:54,107 --> 02:02:55,509
See you.
Bye, Baby!

2087
02:02:55,642 --> 02:02:56,643
Let's go, Raja.

2088
02:03:02,349 --> 02:03:04,318
Not one interview of yours
is here.

2089
02:03:04,451 --> 02:03:08,889
The future of Deccan Air
remains a question mark.

2090
02:03:09,923 --> 02:03:13,026
Running an airline is not a game!
No wonder it tanked!

2091
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:16,363
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

2092
02:03:16,496 --> 02:03:20,701
Paresh Goswami questions
if the DGCA enquiry commission was bribed.

2093
02:03:20,834 --> 02:03:22,636
Even our advertisement's been buried!

2094
02:03:22,769 --> 02:03:25,205
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

2095
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:29,443
Due to safety issues,
Deccan Air has come to an end.

2096
02:03:32,713 --> 02:03:34,615
They broke people's faith in us.

2097
02:04:07,648 --> 02:04:09,249
A plane, Maha!
Come on, race!

2098
02:04:10,584 --> 02:04:11,418
Maha?

2099
02:04:15,255 --> 02:04:17,424
Welcome, welcome.
Come have a drink.

2100
02:04:17,491 --> 02:04:18,158
No, we're good.

2101
02:04:18,292 --> 02:04:20,327
Go ahead, have a drink, man.
Have fun!

2102
02:04:20,394 --> 02:04:23,530
-Why did you call?
-Alright, I'll get to the point.

2103
02:04:23,664 --> 02:04:24,898
Why do we need two airlines?

2104
02:04:25,032 --> 02:04:28,769
I'll merge your company with mine.

2105
02:04:28,936 --> 02:04:30,370
Who will fly in our planes then?

2106
02:04:30,504 --> 02:04:32,105
Of course, only the rich!

2107
02:04:32,239 --> 02:04:35,008
My team said a maximum of 12 crores.

2108
02:04:35,108 --> 02:04:37,244
But I'll give you 15!

2109
02:04:38,579 --> 02:04:40,414
Guys! Do we have a deal?

2110
02:04:42,015 --> 02:04:44,017
Okay. Sixteen crores, then!

2111
02:04:46,987 --> 02:04:50,958
Mahesh, you better take it
before I change my mind.

2112
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:53,260
Sir, give us two minutes.
We'll discuss and get back to you.

2113
02:04:54,127 --> 02:04:54,828
Okay.

2114
02:04:55,362 --> 02:04:57,531
Let's think it over, Maha.

2115
02:04:57,631 --> 02:04:58,532
I already have.

2116
02:04:59,266 --> 02:04:59,933
No.

2117
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,735
Why are you taking a risk?

2118
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:03,437
It's a great offer.
Take it, man!

2119
02:05:06,073 --> 02:05:08,475
Sometimes, I get doubts
about my airline's success.

2120
02:05:09,543 --> 02:05:11,478
But the way you're lusting after it

2121
02:05:12,713 --> 02:05:13,814
my doubts are all gone.

2122
02:05:13,947 --> 02:05:16,683
Come on. You've no business sense.

2123
02:05:17,217 --> 02:05:20,687
You can't survive a day here
without my support.

2124
02:05:20,954 --> 02:05:22,523
I don't get you, man!

2125
02:05:23,290 --> 02:05:24,157
You won't.

2126
02:05:24,925 --> 02:05:26,693
You're a socialite.
I'm a socialist.

2127
02:05:27,628 --> 02:05:29,997
We are nothing alike.

2128
02:05:30,664 --> 02:05:31,565
Imbecile!

2129
02:05:31,899 --> 02:05:32,666
Let's go!

2130
02:05:33,734 --> 02:05:35,435
-Did he call me an imbecile?
-Yes, sir.

2131
02:05:36,937 --> 02:05:39,106
How can you decide alone?

2132
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:40,941
Don't you need to discuss it with us?

2133
02:05:41,074 --> 02:05:42,910
I quit my job because of you!

2134
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:44,111
Is that nothing to you?

2135
02:05:45,078 --> 02:05:46,313
You call this a partnership?

2136
02:05:48,282 --> 02:05:49,550
You'll bring us to the streets?

2137
02:05:50,017 --> 02:05:51,018
What's your problem?

2138
02:05:51,919 --> 02:05:52,619
Tell me!

2139
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,454
You're crazy!

2140
02:05:54,588 --> 02:05:56,456
Think about us too.
We all are in deep shit.

2141
02:05:56,590 --> 02:06:00,294
Seby has a family to feed!
My dad cut me off when I quit my job!

2142
02:06:00,427 --> 02:06:01,662
Aren't we human beings too!

2143
02:06:01,862 --> 02:06:04,631
Who can stick with you?
Is your wife happy at least?

2144
02:06:04,965 --> 02:06:06,333
-Hey.
-Hey, hey!

2145
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:07,434
What are you doing?

2146
02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:09,770
Go on, hit me!

2147
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:12,139
Don't hit the bellies of the villagers
relying on you!

2148
02:06:12,272 --> 02:06:14,875
Am I? That dog inside doesn't get it!
Don't you, too?

2149
02:06:15,008 --> 02:06:17,845
By turning him down,
we make a billion Indians fly one day!

2150
02:06:17,978 --> 02:06:19,513
Why are we here?

2151
02:06:19,646 --> 02:06:21,348
Do you get
what is he asking us to sell?

2152
02:06:22,716 --> 02:06:24,718
Our dream.
Don't you get that?

2153
02:07:12,666 --> 02:07:13,901
How much did he offer?

2154
02:07:15,335 --> 02:07:16,436
Sixteen crores.

2155
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,505
Did you take it?

2156
02:07:31,552 --> 02:07:33,253
I let down our family, Baby.

2157
02:07:35,055 --> 02:07:36,023
Did you poison the food?

2158
02:07:37,224 --> 02:07:38,759
I would have, if you sold out.

2159
02:07:51,471 --> 02:07:53,640
This is a small show
on All India Radio.

2160
02:07:53,774 --> 02:07:55,909
It will do, ma'am.
It's the language of my people.

2161
02:07:56,043 --> 02:07:58,245
I'll talk to the new FM stations.

2162
02:07:58,378 --> 02:08:00,247
They're growing.
You'll get a wider reach.

2163
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:03,917
Ready?

2164
02:08:04,585 --> 02:08:08,989
Five, four, three, two, one.

2165
02:08:09,656 --> 02:08:10,324
Go!

2166
02:08:10,991 --> 02:08:11,692
Sir?

2167
02:08:13,627 --> 02:08:15,529
We look at the skies
with awe,

2168
02:08:15,963 --> 02:08:18,065
but wouldn't dare dream
of seeing the world from up there.

2169
02:08:18,398 --> 02:08:19,166
Same thing back home.

2170
02:08:19,299 --> 02:08:22,970
But today, we've risen too
and come to fly.

2171
02:08:23,637 --> 02:08:26,340
Goswami's afraid of sub-standard people
entering the industry.

2172
02:08:27,241 --> 02:08:28,642
Yes.
He is terrified of us.

2173
02:08:28,842 --> 02:08:31,311
But, not for the reasons he claims.

2174
02:08:31,778 --> 02:08:35,249
He knows well that our airline
passed every safety test like his.

2175
02:08:36,049 --> 02:08:37,017
So, what does he fear?

2176
02:08:37,251 --> 02:08:40,287
He fears that those beneath him
will rise to his level.

2177
02:08:41,288 --> 02:08:44,024
The rich want the poor to remain poor.

2178
02:08:45,492 --> 02:08:47,528
A century ago, they claimed
electricity was only for them.

2179
02:08:48,161 --> 02:08:49,997
Fifty years ago,
they said that about cars.

2180
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:51,131
Who are they to decide?

2181
02:08:51,865 --> 02:08:54,101
No one except them
should enjoy it all, right?

2182
02:08:55,135 --> 02:08:59,173
We spend days
to go from place to place.

2183
02:08:59,773 --> 02:09:00,941
But the rich?

2184
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:02,943
They fly like Gods above us!

2185
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:06,013
If we level with them,
no one will be beneath them.

2186
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,314
That's what he fears!

2187
02:09:07,447 --> 02:09:10,551
You can now book plane tickets
over the phone.

2188
02:09:10,784 --> 02:09:12,386
We will give you a PNR number.

2189
02:09:12,519 --> 02:09:16,857
Just show the number
at your bank or post office.

2190
02:09:16,990 --> 02:09:18,959
Why do small towns remain small?

2191
02:09:19,326 --> 02:09:20,160
Why haven't they grown?

2192
02:09:20,661 --> 02:09:22,796
To grow,
sometimes we must walk

2193
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:24,565
sometimes, we must run

2194
02:09:24,698 --> 02:09:26,233
and sometimes, we have to fly!

2195
02:09:26,533 --> 02:09:28,535
That is called as air connectivity.

2196
02:09:29,136 --> 02:09:31,405
My airline promises
air connectivity to everyone.

2197
02:09:32,206 --> 02:09:33,941
Our planes will reach
every small town!

2198
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:36,677
And every place will grow!

2199
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:41,181
Won't that scare the privileged?

2200
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:45,752
The Question with Amit Trivedi.

2201
02:09:45,953 --> 02:09:48,255
-Thank you for joining us on The Question.
-Thank you.

2202
02:09:48,655 --> 02:09:52,259
Let's talk about what's on
everyone's mind: Low cost aviation.

2203
02:09:52,492 --> 02:09:53,694
Your thoughts, sir?

2204
02:09:54,428 --> 02:09:55,329
Look, Mr. Amit.

2205
02:09:56,663 --> 02:10:02,135
When flying in an aluminum can
at 1,000 km/hr,

2206
02:10:02,436 --> 02:10:03,937
what will be on your mind?

2207
02:10:04,204 --> 02:10:05,806
-Safety.
-Exactly!

2208
02:10:06,406 --> 02:10:09,910
That safety requires
all kinds of testing and security!

2209
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:13,647
It's expensive,
but is a must!

2210
02:10:14,081 --> 02:10:18,519
When someone offers to lower that price,
people must think hard.

2211
02:10:18,619 --> 02:10:19,953
They have a point, sir.

2212
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:22,422
How can one feel safe
at such low prices?

2213
02:10:22,556 --> 02:10:25,192
I have a question
for Goswami on safety.

2214
02:10:25,526 --> 02:10:28,562
His first class tickets
cost three times more than economy.

2215
02:10:28,929 --> 02:10:30,397
Should there be an accident

2216
02:10:30,531 --> 02:10:33,967
would he guarantee thrice the safety
to first class passengers?

2217
02:10:34,101 --> 02:10:35,602
But I will guarantee you this.

2218
02:10:36,904 --> 02:10:40,107
The Deccan Air pilots
flew fighter jets for India.

2219
02:10:40,908 --> 02:10:43,243
Who can fly you safer than them?

2220
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:48,448
Here's why we are afraid
of Chandra Mahesh entering our business.

2221
02:10:48,582 --> 02:10:51,618
Shoddy equipment.

2222
02:10:51,752 --> 02:10:53,620
Retired pilots.

2223
02:10:54,054 --> 02:10:55,722
Sub-standard products.

2224
02:10:55,789 --> 02:10:58,759
He brings in many dangers.

2225
02:10:59,626 --> 02:11:02,496
The enquiry commission
cleared us of all charges.

2226
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:06,266
I have no money
to bribe them.

2227
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:11,471
I won't pay bribes
with my people's hard earned money.

2228
02:11:12,673 --> 02:11:15,576
If money was my priority,
I'd have made millions ages ago!

2229
02:11:15,676 --> 02:11:17,978
Or I'd gladly tend to my home
and child.

2230
02:11:18,111 --> 02:11:19,913
Because my wife's very successful.

2231
02:11:20,914 --> 02:11:22,783
You talk of so many obstacles.

2232
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:24,585
Why do you go on?

2233
02:11:25,752 --> 02:11:28,856
My father wanted electricity
in our village. We got it.

2234
02:11:28,989 --> 02:11:30,657
He wanted a train for us.
We got it.

2235
02:11:30,791 --> 02:11:33,160
I want the benefits of modern science
to reach everyone.

2236
02:11:33,293 --> 02:11:36,496
I want to break the cost barrier
and the damn caste barrier too!

2237
02:11:36,630 --> 02:11:38,665
That's why our tickets
cost one rupee.

2238
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:40,300
With quality and safety.

2239
02:11:40,601 --> 02:11:43,670
When flying on a legacy airline
like Jaz

2240
02:11:44,037 --> 02:11:46,773
you're completely assured
of safety.

2241
02:11:47,107 --> 02:11:51,144
As we have a well-trained crew
and the best infrastructure

2242
02:11:51,211 --> 02:11:53,413
our ticket prices
will be higher!

2243
02:11:54,147 --> 02:11:55,349
But...

2244
02:11:55,482 --> 02:12:00,287
Mahesh's stripping away all this
and offering dirt cheap tickets!

2245
02:12:00,387 --> 02:12:01,388
Tell me,

2246
02:12:01,522 --> 02:12:04,191
is your life worth
the same as a cup of tea?

2247
02:12:06,226 --> 02:12:07,594
My flights are safe.

2248
02:12:08,562 --> 02:12:11,198
All I'll say to those who don't trust
our safety report is this.

2249
02:12:11,331 --> 02:12:13,233
This is my own safety test!

2250
02:12:13,367 --> 02:12:16,670
The three people I love the most
will be on Deccan's first flights.

2251
02:12:18,805 --> 02:12:19,806
My mother Parvathi.

2252
02:12:22,309 --> 02:12:23,410
My wife Sundari.

2253
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:27,214
My daughter Ammu.

2254
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,886
Giving airlines to such people

2255
02:12:33,253 --> 02:12:36,690
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill!

2256
02:12:37,024 --> 02:12:40,561
This must be nipped in the bud!
It's a scary prospect!

2257
02:12:40,694 --> 02:12:43,830
Listen to him some more
and even I'll believe him!

2258
02:12:43,997 --> 02:12:46,099
Do you have any proof
for those acquisitions?

2259
02:12:47,034 --> 02:12:48,602
Maha! Maha!

2260
02:12:49,236 --> 02:12:49,937
-Maha!
-Maha!

2261
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:50,938
Maha, hold on!

2262
02:12:51,038 --> 02:12:53,507
We've been trying to reach you!
What happened?

2263
02:12:54,641 --> 02:12:56,410
My cell battery's also dead, I guess.

2264
02:12:56,844 --> 02:12:59,513
You've not slept in three days.
You'll go crazy this way.

2265
02:13:00,013 --> 02:13:01,548
How can I sleep?

2266
02:13:02,115 --> 02:13:05,352
He could do anything to our planes.
We need to guard them.

2267
02:13:06,019 --> 02:13:06,687
Maha!

2268
02:13:24,271 --> 02:13:25,339
What's up, Chandra Mahesh?

2269
02:13:26,573 --> 02:13:28,542
Only Goswami has friends or what?

2270
02:13:28,942 --> 02:13:30,711
Don't we have friends?

2271
02:13:31,411 --> 02:13:33,280
We never let down our comrades!

2272
02:13:34,915 --> 02:13:36,083
Go and take rest, man!

2273
02:13:36,783 --> 02:13:38,519
I have this covered!

2274
02:13:40,087 --> 02:13:41,522
Get into position, boys!

2275
02:13:44,157 --> 02:13:44,825
Sir.

2276
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:55,702
Take care of the wing tip clearance,
Mohan!

2277
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:58,472
All in position at Bay 63?

2278
02:13:58,705 --> 02:14:01,008
...traveling flight DA 581,

2279
02:14:01,542 --> 02:14:03,310
please proceed to gate number two.

2280
02:14:32,806 --> 02:14:34,908
-Are we ready for boarding?
-Yes, Captain.

2281
02:14:34,975 --> 02:14:35,709
Okay.

2282
02:14:35,976 --> 02:14:37,344
Luggage tractors can go there,
right?

2283
02:14:42,449 --> 02:14:44,117
Welcome, Captain.
Welcome.

2284
02:14:56,730 --> 02:14:57,631
Just a minute, Raghava.

2285
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:12,980
It's faster to get to my hometown by bus!

2286
02:15:14,114 --> 02:15:16,250
Why is only our plane parked so far away?

2287
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:19,052
No matter where they throw us,
we will fly.

2288
02:15:24,558 --> 02:15:26,493
-Go on.
-Good day, ma'am. Sir.

2289
02:15:29,496 --> 02:15:31,632
We're really happy
to have you on board, ma'am.

2290
02:15:32,232 --> 02:15:34,768
-There are no passengers?
-There's still time, ma'am.

2291
02:15:37,771 --> 02:15:39,106
They'll come, won't they?

2292
02:15:40,574 --> 02:15:41,241
They will.

2293
02:15:44,745 --> 02:15:46,713
This is the last and final call

2294
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:48,749
for passengers traveling
from Chennai to Thoothukudi

2295
02:15:48,882 --> 02:15:54,288
on flight DA-581,
which is set to take off in a few minutes.

2296
02:15:54,354 --> 02:15:56,990
I repeat, this is the last and final call

2297
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:02,362
for passengers traveling to Thoothukudi
on flight DA 581.

2298
02:16:02,496 --> 02:16:03,730
Cheer up!
We'll handle it!

2299
02:16:10,604 --> 02:16:15,209
It's doubtful if people
will risk their lives and fly Deccan Air.

2300
02:16:32,125 --> 02:16:34,194
People will reject
such an unsafe airline.

2301
02:16:34,261 --> 02:16:36,997
And yes, it does look like the end
for Deccan Air.

2302
02:17:02,456 --> 02:17:04,458
Our flight's been cancelled,
Captain.

2303
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:52,439
People didn't believe me, Baby.

2304
02:17:55,576 --> 02:17:56,243
Let's go.

2305
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:05,752
Airplanes are for the rich!
Not for people like us!

2306
02:18:06,353 --> 02:18:10,090
They play with our feelings
and royally screw us!

2307
02:18:11,792 --> 02:18:14,661
You're out of your league!
Go home and graze your cows!

2308
02:18:16,263 --> 02:18:19,333
Giving airlines to such people

2309
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:22,536
is akin to giving guns
to the mentally ill!

2310
02:18:23,003 --> 02:18:26,440
Wow! He remembers their plight!

2311
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:28,942
Thought you forgot
as you were busy reproducing!

2312
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:31,912
We are all praying for you, my son!

2313
02:18:32,045 --> 02:18:33,213
You should win!

2314
02:18:33,647 --> 02:18:35,449
We are all counting on you.

2315
02:18:37,284 --> 02:18:40,320
He spent just ten minutes
thinking about you

2316
02:18:40,687 --> 02:18:42,389
and you're finished!

2317
02:19:14,688 --> 02:19:15,355
Maha!

2318
02:19:19,193 --> 02:19:21,395
I'm sorry, Maha!
I screwed up!

2319
02:19:21,862 --> 02:19:22,996
You trusted me!

2320
02:19:23,597 --> 02:19:24,965
-Forget it!
-I messed up!

2321
02:19:25,065 --> 02:19:27,301
We tried.
That's what matters.

2322
02:19:27,601 --> 02:19:30,003
We came so close and screwed up!

2323
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:32,506
I fucked up the Chennai booking!

2324
02:19:35,843 --> 02:19:36,810
What are you saying?

2325
02:19:37,511 --> 02:19:38,312
Be clear!

2326
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:42,749
The Chennai flight tickets
were not confirmed from our end!

2327
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:45,919
All bookings in our software
rolled back and got cancelled.

2328
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:49,289
That's why none of our passengers came,
despite booking tickets!

2329
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,694
Maha!

2330
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:58,165
They were unable
to board our flight!

2331
02:20:03,971 --> 02:20:05,305
The problem was in the software!

2332
02:20:06,507 --> 02:20:07,808
People didn't lose faith in us!

2333
02:20:08,742 --> 02:20:10,777
Thousands of our tickets were sold!

2334
02:20:38,372 --> 02:20:39,773
People believed us!

2335
02:20:40,307 --> 02:20:41,708
The other two flights...

2336
02:20:43,076 --> 02:20:44,711
They were fully booked!

2337
02:20:45,412 --> 02:20:47,314
They flew at full capacity!

2338
02:20:48,081 --> 02:20:51,218
We won, Maha!

2339
02:21:04,064 --> 02:21:09,970
Your love brought the skies
Within our grasp

2340
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:16,710
This will live on
Even when time is gone!

2341
02:21:17,244 --> 02:21:22,950
In the desert in our eyes
We wished for a few raindrops

2342
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:28,989
Now, with your downpour
Our village smiles lush green

2343
02:21:29,156 --> 02:21:29,823
Super, bro!

2344
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:35,929
The saplings in the soil
In an attempt to touch the sky

2345
02:21:36,463 --> 02:21:42,069
Suddenly take flight
Soaring towards the stars

2346
02:21:42,836 --> 02:21:48,542
In this scorching summer
As the full moon sheds coolness

2347
02:21:49,276 --> 02:21:53,013
Our hearts feel festive

2348
02:21:53,247 --> 02:21:54,581
Maha, my boy...

2349
02:21:55,482 --> 02:21:59,086
I'm so happy to have flown
in your plane today!

2350
02:21:59,152 --> 02:22:02,289
I've dreamt for years to fly.

2351
02:22:02,456 --> 02:22:04,124
Even my son couldn't
make it happen.

2352
02:22:04,291 --> 02:22:07,661
But today,
with my own savings

2353
02:22:07,828 --> 02:22:11,131
I flew all the way here!
How about that!

2354
02:22:11,298 --> 02:22:13,066
See you, son.

2355
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,268
Let's go!

2356
02:22:15,269 --> 02:22:15,936
Buddy!

2357
02:22:16,003 --> 02:22:20,307
Now, with your downpour,
our village smiles lush green!

2358
02:22:27,514 --> 02:22:33,320
As mother fed her little girl
Plate in hand

2359
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:39,593
She pointed to the faraway moon

2360
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:46,066
Now, thanks to you, the time has come
To ascend a ladder to the sky

2361
02:22:46,266 --> 02:22:47,467
There are no stops

2362
02:22:47,601 --> 02:22:48,836
How was it?

2363
02:22:49,536 --> 02:22:52,105
In the path you tread!

2364
02:22:52,506 --> 02:22:58,478
There are no stops
In the path you tread!

2365
02:23:05,752 --> 02:23:08,755
"Parvathi says he will fly."

2366
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:13,026
"But I know he won't rest
until he makes everyone fly with him!"

2367
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:14,361
My darling!

2368
02:23:15,896 --> 02:23:17,364
You did it!

2369
02:23:20,434 --> 02:23:21,702
My dear boy!

2370
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:24,371
You won!

2371
02:23:25,939 --> 02:23:27,441
Bless you, my boy!

2372
02:23:41,355 --> 02:23:42,155
Hello.

2373
02:23:42,356 --> 02:23:43,190
It's for you.

2374
02:23:43,423 --> 02:23:44,458
Watch what you say.

2375
02:23:44,525 --> 02:23:45,192
Hello?

2376
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:48,161
Congratulations, Mr. Mahesh!

2377
02:23:48,529 --> 02:23:51,265
Can we meet?
I have a business proposal for you.

2378
02:23:51,398 --> 02:23:54,034
I was expecting your call,
Mr. Goswami.

2379
02:23:54,601 --> 02:23:55,836
Good, good, good.

2380
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:58,972
I'll have my secretary fix an appointment.
Okay?

2381
02:23:59,806 --> 02:24:01,375
Who are you to give me an appointment?

2382
02:24:02,209 --> 02:24:03,010
What?

2383
02:24:03,544 --> 02:24:05,946
It doesn't matter whether I'm around
or you try to stop me.

2384
02:24:07,214 --> 02:24:10,584
The farmer has flown
and will continue to fly.

2385
02:24:10,684 --> 02:24:12,619
You don't own the sky, you scum.

2386
02:24:12,786 --> 02:24:14,621
-Mr. Mahesh?
-Now fuck off!

2387
02:24:19,092 --> 02:24:23,297
Lay a hand on me if you dare
Silence will resound

2388
02:24:23,497 --> 02:24:27,734
You'll be crushed under the heels
Of a fierce horse!

2389
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:42,015
Transformed, have my ways of hunting
Lay a hand on me if you dare

2390
02:25:44,578 --> 02:25:45,279
What is it?

2391
02:25:46,346 --> 02:25:49,049
You messing with me, you hag?
What do you want?

2392
02:25:50,884 --> 02:25:52,419
Want to fly for a buck, huh?

2393
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:08,402
Forget the plane, buddy!

2394
02:26:08,535 --> 02:26:10,904
The cakes which they provided!
So damn delicious!

2395
02:26:11,238 --> 02:26:15,142
I'll fly over and over
just for these cakes!

2396
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:17,277
Hey bunface...

2397
02:26:19,313 --> 02:26:20,113
Whose idea was it?

2398
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:23,817
Spark the coal
Which lies within your core

2399
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:26,753
It's such a pleasure to meet up with you!

2400
02:26:27,254 --> 02:26:30,557
Drop the act!
How dare you sabotage the plane I was in.

2401
02:26:30,757 --> 02:26:33,093
Let's see how your planes are gonna fly!

2402
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:34,761
-Sir, please let me explain!
-Sir, please come out!

2403
02:26:37,831 --> 02:26:42,636
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

2404
02:26:42,769 --> 02:26:47,241
Emerge as a diamond
And they'll shut their wagging tongues

2405
02:26:47,407 --> 02:26:51,745
The unworthy will taunt you
Unaware of your worth

2406
02:26:52,446 --> 02:26:53,380
First time flyer?

2407
02:26:53,514 --> 02:26:56,216
Nah! I've flown these things in circles!

2408
02:26:57,584 --> 02:26:58,452
It's okay.

2409
02:27:01,221 --> 02:27:02,489
Yeah, first time.

2410
02:27:03,156 --> 02:27:05,259
Give wings to dreams
That trust in you and soar

2411
02:27:10,364 --> 02:27:14,067
The sky is the limit

2412
02:27:19,072 --> 02:27:22,976
Let this chance not pass you by

2413
02:27:30,384 --> 02:27:33,086
-What do you do?
-I run a grooming establishment.

2414
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:35,455
-Meaning?
-I cut hair in my village.

2415
02:27:35,622 --> 02:27:36,757
-I see...
-Own business!

2416
02:27:36,823 --> 02:27:39,226
-And you?
-I run a business, too!

2417
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:40,327
Don't you recognize him?

2418
02:27:40,394 --> 02:27:42,629
He has a huge clothing store
in Bejawada!

2419
02:27:42,829 --> 02:27:45,566
He gave thirty one lakhs
to our fund for Mahesh! A big man!

2420
02:27:45,666 --> 02:27:47,267
There's no difference between us anymore!

2421
02:27:47,768 --> 02:27:50,437
He's broken down all that
and made us fly together!

2422
02:27:54,341 --> 02:27:55,242
Maha...

2423
02:27:56,977 --> 02:27:59,146
Did that girl fly the plane?

2424
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:06,653
To hell with business class!
Tear it apart!

2425
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:09,356
They paid for it.
They can sit wherever they please!

2426
02:28:09,923 --> 02:28:13,894
Let not your limitations
Draw your boundaries

2427
02:28:13,961 --> 02:28:16,129
Why the hurry to pay me back?

2428
02:28:16,263 --> 02:28:18,465
You'll need more
as you're growing.

2429
02:28:18,532 --> 02:28:19,933
Feel free to ask anytime!

2430
02:28:20,067 --> 02:28:21,969
We should make a film about you
and run it here!

2431
02:28:22,035 --> 02:28:24,004
He thinks this shack
is an IMAX theatre!

2432
02:28:24,338 --> 02:28:27,307
Let's go, Maha.
This guy thinks he's Director Mani Ratnam!

2433
02:28:27,674 --> 02:28:31,778
