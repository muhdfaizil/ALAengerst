<i>This is live coverage</i>

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.816
<i>of the 1959
24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.416
<i>We've reached
the halfway point</i>

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.020
<i>and so far witnessed
Aston Martin number 5,</i>

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.554
<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,</i>

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:06.091
<i>making great gains
in the last hour.</i>

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.491
<i>If he keeps this pace up,</i>

00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.027
<i>he could have
a chance at the...</i>

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.779
He's coming in.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.915
He's coming in.
Let's go, let's go.

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:32.017
- Tires!
- Let's go, let's go.

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:33.285
I know you're tired,
but come on,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:34.286
let's make this fast.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.821
Move, move, move!

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.291
She's running a little hot,
but we're good.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.792
Tires are still gripping.

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:42.326
Fire! The fuel! Fire!

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:43.995
- Shelby, it's you!
- Grab that blanket!

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:47.631
Get off me! Off!

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:51.335
You okay?

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.006
Fill the tank!

00:01:56.607 --> 00:01:58.810
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:01.947
Am I on goddamn fire?

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:03.614
- No, you're not on fire.
- Fill the damn tank!

00:02:03.714 --> 00:02:05.016
- Fill the tank.
- Fill the tank.

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.184
Get it ready!

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.420
- Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up, my friend.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.487
Car's yours.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:12.123
Go get 'em.

00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:35.512
<i>Aston Martin number 5,</i>

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.916
<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,
has maintained his lead</i>

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.417
<i>as we're nearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:41.585
<i>Shelby.</i>

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:42.988
<i>The checkered flag is out.</i>

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:46.024
<i>The crowd are on their feet.</i>

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:46.892
<i>Shelby.</i>

00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:48.159
<i>...takes the title!</i>

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.327
<i>An American wins Le Mans.</i>

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:50.628
<i>Shelby.</i>

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.265
Carroll Shelby.

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:54.598
What?

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.768
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:58.970
Oh, I take the pills.
The pills work.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.908
An elevated
heart rate, say 130 BPM,

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:05.310
sustained even
for a short period,

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:07.112
you run a critical risk
of cardiac arrest.

00:03:07.212 --> 00:03:09.580
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.384
Well, I could race NASCAR.
Formula One.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.418
The valve is shot, Shelby.

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:16.520
This is as serious as it gets.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.790
In my opinion, you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.093
Well, I feel real lucky.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.163
Luckiest guy on earth.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:47.285
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM</i>

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.254
<i>where everything fades.</i>

00:03:57.963 --> 00:04:01.032
<i>The machine
becomes weightless.</i>

00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:02.233
<i>Just disappears.</i>

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:04.970
Hey!

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.938
Watch it, buddy!

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:14.145
<i>And all that's left
is a body</i>

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:16.047
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:23.955
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:27.025
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:32.629
<i>It asks you a question.</i>

00:04:33.597 --> 00:04:35.000
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:39.971
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.880
Now, it's von Trips
in the Ferrari,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.714
coming into the corkscrew.
He's braking late.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:51.916
Hey, I called you
three times,

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:53.318
and you never answer
the phone.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.585
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:55.920
I answer the phone
every time it rings.

00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.422
- No, sir, you do not.
- Yes, I do.

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.490
No, you don't.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.759
A month ago, this car was fun.

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:04.729
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does,

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.264
it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:08.632
When I pull out
of the driveway,

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:11.069
the dog has a heart attack.

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.304
All I'm asking is for
you to make it like it was.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:15.340
Yeah, you've coked up

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.875
the inlet valves
and the plugs.

00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:18.309
Nothing wrong with the car,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.444
just the way
it's being driven.

00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:20.677
The way
it's being driven?

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.846
Too much fuel,
not enough spark.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.048
That's what's
making her misfire.

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:24.681
You wanna run that
by me in English?

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:28.086
All right, sir.

00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:31.322
So...

00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:34.558
that there,
that is a sport car.

00:05:34.658 --> 00:05:36.693
You have to drive her
like a sport car.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.595
If you drive her
like a school teacher,

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:39.964
she'll clog up. All right?

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:43.535
Try changing up
at 5,000 RPM, not two.

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:47.872
Drive like you mean it.
Hard and tight.

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:49.207
She'll run clean.

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:51.076
Are you telling me
I don't know

00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:53.044
how to drive my own car?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.313
No.

00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:57.048
But if you ask me,
this isn't your car.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:01.152
Your car's more a Plymouth
or a Studebaker.

00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:04.355
You and me have
a problem, buddy?

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.225
I don't have a problem.
I had an MG.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.592
Mine ran just fine.

00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:10.361
Screw you, you limey prick.

00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:11.563
I want my money back.

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.932
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:16.201
But you haven't paid
for last month's service yet.

00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:18.570
This country,
the customer's always right.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:19.804
You ever hear that?

00:06:19.904 --> 00:06:22.207
Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:23.707
Utter nonsense.

00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:26.311
Now remember,
I advanced the timing,

00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:29.547
so a smidge twitchy in first.

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:32.517
Get the revs up.
Good lad. Revs up.

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:35.787
Ta-ra.

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:40.091
Another satisfied customer?

00:06:42.961 --> 00:06:44.729
Can I help you, miss?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.665
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.669
Ah, you know your cars.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.305
Well, I like them.

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.407
I love the sound they make.

00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:58.209
The way it goes
right through you.

00:06:58.476 --> 00:06:59.611
Right.

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:02.113
That vibration.

00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:07.819
Mine's the wood-paneled

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.054
Country Squire...

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:11.789
across the street.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.160
A real hot rod.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.394
Oh, yeah?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.263
- Is it fast?
- Very.

00:07:18.796 --> 00:07:20.999
Wait a second.
What type of girl are ya?

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.835
Type of girl who likes
the smell of wet gasoline.

00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:25.236
- Oh.
- Burnt rubber.

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:27.639
Oh, what, are you some kind
of a deviant,

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:28.973
are ya?

00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.075
Well, only since
I married you.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.385
Hey, Gar,
what's going on?

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:41.718
Something's up.

00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:44.222
Hi, Lee.

00:07:44.322 --> 00:07:45.456
Listen,
he isn't as sure as you are

00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:46.791
about the banks.

00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:50.061
I'm not as sure
about this...

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:52.830
How's this going out?

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.336
- Don, what's going on?
- I don't know.

00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:00.872
Mr. Ford,
welcome to the room.

00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:01.973
Good afternoon,
Mr. Ford.

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:03.408
Nice to see you, sir.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.148
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

00:08:17.088 --> 00:08:18.122
John!

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:24.262
All stop.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.774
Hear that?

00:08:39.244 --> 00:08:43.448
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company...

00:08:44.182 --> 00:08:46.117
out of business.

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:56.928
In 1899, my grandfather,
Henry, by God, Ford...

00:08:57.228 --> 00:09:00.565
was walking home
from Edison Illumination

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.800
after working a double shift.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.469
He was ruminating.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.872
That morning,
he had himself an idea

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:10.108
that changed the world.

00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:12.243
Sixty-five years

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.780
and 47 million
automobiles later,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.982
what shall be his legacy?

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.521
Getting it in the tail pipe
from a Chevy Impala.

00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:30.161
Here's what I want you to do.

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.896
Walk home.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:39.170
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

00:09:39.671 --> 00:09:42.775
Man comes to my office
with an idea,

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.476
that man keeps his job.

00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:49.213
Rest of you
second-best losers...

00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:51.349
stay home.

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:53.351
You don't belong at Ford.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:06.497
Shelby!

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.468
I see you.
Up and at 'em, buddy.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.639
- Hey!
- Go away.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.607
Come on. You can do it.

00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:19.477
Come on, baby.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.846
8:30 a.m., time to roll.

00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:23.181
Let's go.

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:25.717
- Let's go. Let's go, go, go.
- Go away.

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:28.252
It's 8:30 a.m., baby.
Time to roll.

00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:30.955
Come on.

00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:32.758
Hey, Phil.

00:10:32.857 --> 00:10:34.092
Hey, Bob.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:35.093
Is Shelby here?

00:10:35.193 --> 00:10:37.261
Uh, it's touch and go.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.203
Shelby, you're up
bright and early.

00:10:45.303 --> 00:10:48.606
Well, early bird gets
the worm, Pops.

00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:54.212
All right,
who you worried about?

00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:57.415
Well, you got Red Faris
and Bill Rushton.

00:10:57.515 --> 00:10:58.883
They're all in 327s.

00:10:58.983 --> 00:11:00.451
Corvettes.
What about Bondurant?

00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:02.220
Bondurant? Well,
he's still driving...

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.622
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?
- ...for Washburn.

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:06.825
Number 614.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.260
- Thank you so much.
- All right, just relax. All right.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.462
We're gonna eat those Vettes
for breakfast.

00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:12.897
We're lighter, we're faster,

00:11:12.997 --> 00:11:14.465
and that don't work,
we're nastier.

00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:17.135
<i>Hey, Dad,
before the race starts,</i>

00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:19.070
<i>take your son over
to the Willow Springs...</i>

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.373
Hey, Phil. Hey,
take it easy on us today, bud.

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.612
You all right?

00:11:27.712 --> 00:11:28.847
Paragraph 15.4,

00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:30.681
section 2b
of the SCCA standard

00:11:30.783 --> 00:11:33.050
dictates all AF class cars
must have

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.754
minimum trunk space
of 20 inches by 12 inches

00:11:35.854 --> 00:11:37.188
by six inches.

00:11:37.555 --> 00:11:38.923
Your trunk doesn't close.

00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:41.192
- Ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:43.796
Ergo car is disqualified
from said Class A competition.

00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:45.096
No, no, no. Look, look, look.

00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:46.397
Can I ask you a question,
all right?

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:49.233
When you were a little boy,
did you think,

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.302
"When I grow up, I want to go

00:11:51.402 --> 00:11:53.538
"to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway,

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.407
"and I want to enforce
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:59.143
"of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity"?

00:11:59.243 --> 00:12:00.711
- All right, that's it.
- Did you?

00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:04.315
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:07.585
Ah, well,
if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.755
- Ah, Shelby.
- How you doing, Lance?

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:10.923
- Pops.
- Hey, Lance.

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.356
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:13.792
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville.

00:12:13.892 --> 00:12:15.426
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:17.962
You're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

00:12:18.062 --> 00:12:19.865
Seeing results
for your Cobra, too.

00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:21.900
- Thank you.
- Your guy Miles is impressive.

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:23.501
- Oh, you following Miles?
- Oh, yes.

00:12:23.601 --> 00:12:26.404
Well, he was a USAC
road racing champ in '61.

00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:28.005
He won
the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:30.809
He was SCCA C-class champion
three years in a row

00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:33.010
in this piece-of-shit MG
he built himself.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.880
We heard he's, uh, difficult.

00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:36.748
What, Ken? No, no.
Ken's a puppy dog.

00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:39.083
Hey, Lance, tell the man.
You've raced against Ken.

00:12:39.183 --> 00:12:41.787
Oh, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:44.756
Well, Brumos is looking
for a driver

00:12:44.857 --> 00:12:46.591
for our number two car
at Sebring.

00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.359
- Is that right?
- How is that even possible?

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:50.161
Think your guy Miles
can make the grade?

00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:52.129
- Oh, well, Ken...
- Is he, mate? Hey!

00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:55.066
Jim! Is he putting
his bloody carryall

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:56.300
- in your trunk?
- What?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.668
Discretionary infraction.

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:59.337
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:02.707
To be honest,
Ken was born for Sebring.

00:13:03.775 --> 00:13:06.210
Nothing in there
about my trunk

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.613
and your lovely
little portmanteau.

00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:12.283
You're holding
the '62 edition of the SCCA.

00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:16.621
And you can stick
this bloody sticker

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.055
where the sun don't shine.

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:19.958
Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems
to be the problem, Bill?

00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:22.527
The problem is that
Bill here is an arsehole.

00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:25.062
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

00:13:25.162 --> 00:13:28.533
No, he really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.501
- I'm just doing my job here.
- Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.670
In my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.505
Something like this, there's
always a middle ground.

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:35.841
All right?
Now, Ken's outta line.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:36.909
And I'm just doing my job.

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:38.075
I understand you are.

00:13:38.175 --> 00:13:39.043
You know how he gets
on a race day.

00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:40.344
You know that. All right?

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:41.914
But you're not gonna DQ us
over a trunk.

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:50.989
- What?
- You see that guy?

00:13:51.088 --> 00:13:52.390
Got his tail up.

00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:00.698
Happy, Bill?

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.736
Bill, I'll handle it.
I'll talk to him.

00:14:04.836 --> 00:14:07.371
I'll talk to him. You just go
and have a great day.

00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:09.473
<i>Hey, folks, feeling hungry?</i>

00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:11.509
<i>Head on over
to the snack bar...</i>

00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:12.778
Shit.

00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:14.679
- Bulldog.
- Huh?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.816
You know who that was
I was just talking to?

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:18.917
Bill.

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:20.251
- Before that.
- No.

00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:22.186
It was Dieter Voss.

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:23.588
Who's that?

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.324
He runs Porsche, Ken.

00:14:26.424 --> 00:14:28.526
It's a little German car company.
Maybe you heard of it.

00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:29.493
All right.

00:14:29.594 --> 00:14:31.095
He wanted you to drive
at Sebring.

00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:33.097
But he'd heard
you were difficult.

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:43.474
I thought we felt the same way
about, uh, Germans.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.513
Do you like losing, Ken?

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:52.516
Excuse me?

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.819
Oh, you heard me.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.954
I don't lose.

00:14:56.755 --> 00:15:00.291
Without sponsors,
you get no car, Ken.

00:15:00.391 --> 00:15:02.094
And last I checked,
the professionals

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.895
- all have a car.
- Shel!

00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:06.130
You cannot win the SCCA
without one.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.132
If you're not winning,
you are losing.

00:15:08.232 --> 00:15:10.334
Don't make me lamp this
at your head.

00:15:10.434 --> 00:15:11.837
Did you bring your son
all the way out here

00:15:11.937 --> 00:15:13.038
to watch you
get disqualified

00:15:13.137 --> 00:15:14.672
or just act like a jackass?

00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:20.244
Damn!

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.883
Well, that answers that.

00:15:42.868 --> 00:15:45.202
Peter...

00:15:54.012 --> 00:15:55.646
May I help you,
gentlemen?

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.581
Uh, yes,
is Ken Miles here?

00:15:58.182 --> 00:15:59.117
No.

00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:00.217
We need to speak to Mr. Miles.

00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:01.485
I'm his wife.

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:03.320
<i>Welcome to the 1963</i>

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.389
<i>Willow Springs 100.</i>

00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:08.693
<i>Twelve cars will be competing
in this 40-lap race.</i>

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.930
Hey, Ken,
what happened to your shield?

00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:15.666
New design.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.769
<i>Well, it looks
like we're about to begin.</i>

00:16:17.869 --> 00:16:20.005
<i>The cars have completed
their warm-up lap.</i>

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.706
<i>The green flag is out...</i>

00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:25.342
<i>and they're approaching
the starting line.</i>

00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:26.978
Here we go.

00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:31.215
Oh, bloody hell.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.154
<i>Ken Miles has fallen behind.</i>

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.589
Learn to drive, you pillock!

00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:45.931
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:49.835
Hey, Sam.

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:54.072
Guy wins the 24-hour Le Mans,
suddenly retires,

00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:56.240
starts selling cars.

00:16:57.274 --> 00:16:58.442
It just don't make sense.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:00.812
Well, unless the rumors
are true, of course.

00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:03.414
Oh, what rumors
would those be, Sam?

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:05.851
That Carroll Shelby
quit driving

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:06.885
'cause he lost his nerve.

00:17:12.623 --> 00:17:15.761
I'm gonna out-brake you
on the next turn, Bob.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:29.473
Ha-ha! Nice try, Bob.

00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:48.459
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.</i>

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.761
<i>Twenty-two laps remaining,</i>

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.763
<i>with Phil Hill
and Dan Gurney in the lead.</i>

00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.221
<i>It's been an incredible day</i>

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.488
<i>here at Willow Springs,</i>

00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:19.758
<i>and we've seen
some exciting driving.</i>

00:18:19.858 --> 00:18:23.195
<i>With just one lap remaining
in this 40-lap race,</i>

00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:24.896

00:18:24.996 --> 00:18:27.866
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading

00:18:27.966 --> 00:18:29.301
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.837
<i>Number 18, Red Faris,</i>

00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:32.938
<i>is off the track.</i>

00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:34.806
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney
for the lead</i>

<i>followed by journeyman
Ken Miles.</i>

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.345
Now for you, Dan.

00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:48.286
<i>And they're
coming around the last turn.</i>

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:49.754
<i>Gurney is still in the lead</i>

00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:51.522
<i>with Ken Miles
hot on his heels.</i>

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.832
<i>Miles is looking

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:01.900
Not yet.

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.736
Come on.

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:06.872
<i>Can Gurney hold
him off in the final straight?</i>

00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:07.973
Not yet.

00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:12.210
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.510
Now.

00:19:17.381 --> 00:19:18.850
<i>Miles goes for the shoulder.</i>

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.985
Nice move, Ken.

00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:25.723
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

00:19:25.824 --> 00:19:26.925
Come on.

00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:28.860
<i>It's Corvette versus Cobra</i>

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.461

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.900
Yeah! Ha-ha!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.667
Yeah!

00:19:36.768 --> 00:19:39.503
<i>An incredible
finish for Ken Miles.</i>

00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:42.874
<i>Didn't see that one coming.</i>

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.409
He's difficult but good.

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:46.677
<i>Let's give
everyone a hand</i>

00:19:46.778 --> 00:19:48.013
<i>for one heck of a race.</i>

00:19:48.113 --> 00:19:50.782
That calls
for a nice cup of tea.

00:19:50.882 --> 00:19:52.683
I'll put the kettle on.

00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:53.752
Hop in.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.025
<i>I'm</i>

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.027
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

00:20:02.127 --> 00:20:03.962
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:08.166
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.003
Pops, frame this.

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:25.516
Hey.

00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:28.452
We did it.

00:20:30.587 --> 00:20:32.023
What's wrong?

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:35.260
The IRS came.

00:20:35.927 --> 00:20:37.729
They've padlocked the garage.

00:20:43.068 --> 00:20:44.702
All right, Petey.

00:20:57.481 --> 00:20:58.984
A couple of years ago...

00:21:00.118 --> 00:21:01.786
you said we'd a nest egg.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.554
Correct.

00:21:04.823 --> 00:21:06.257
A couple of years ago.

00:21:06.358 --> 00:21:07.726
Correct.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.966
So just to be clear,
we are buggered.

00:21:15.367 --> 00:21:17.035
Absolutely.

00:21:23.475 --> 00:21:25.043
As in totally?

00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:30.714
As in, not a bean,
or a pot in which to piss.

00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:33.684
Spares, stock, all gone.

00:21:33.785 --> 00:21:36.221
Tools. My tools
are locked up in there.

00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:39.656
I'll figure something out.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.659
In 1945...

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.896
our soldiers came home.

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:47.531
What was the first thing
that they did?

00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:51.668
They had sex.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.872
Seventeen years later,

00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:55.774
those babies, they've grown.

00:21:55.874 --> 00:21:57.308
And they've got jobs.

00:21:57.742 --> 00:21:58.843
They've got licenses.

00:21:59.377 --> 00:22:03.248
But they do not wanna drive
the same dull 50s cars

00:22:03.348 --> 00:22:04.849
that their parents drove.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.086
You see, kids today,
they want glamour.

00:22:08.186 --> 00:22:10.355
They want sex appeal.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:11.655
They want to go fast.

00:22:12.357 --> 00:22:13.391
Gentlemen...

00:22:13.992 --> 00:22:16.261
it's time for
the Ford Motor Company

00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:17.594
to go racing.

00:22:18.997 --> 00:22:21.565
We're already
in racing, Iacocca.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.234
NASCAR?

00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:25.437
It's... it's regional, sir.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.973
If you go to the movies,
you open up a magazine,

00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:31.509
you don't see good ol' boys
from Winston-Salem.

00:22:31.608 --> 00:22:33.178
You see, uh...

00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:35.413
Sophia Loren...

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.049
Monica Vitti.

00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:44.189
James Bond does not drive
a Ford, sir.

00:22:44.556 --> 00:22:46.723
That's because
he's a degenerate.

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:51.429
See?

00:22:51.896 --> 00:22:53.398
God, I'd like to be
a degenerate.

00:22:54.132 --> 00:22:55.699
Um, just give me
one second here, sir.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.135
Is this part of it?

00:22:57.535 --> 00:22:59.537
Is this going anywhere,
Iacocca?

00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:00.839
Just a second, sir.

00:23:00.939 --> 00:23:01.973
All right, all right,
that's enough.

00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:03.174
Sir, if you just bear
with me...

00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:04.242
Turn it off. Lights.

00:23:08.712 --> 00:23:11.682
Lee,
in the last three years,

00:23:11.783 --> 00:23:13.952
you and your marketing team...

00:23:14.385 --> 00:23:19.057
have presided over the worst
sales slump in US history.

00:23:20.892 --> 00:23:24.195
Why exactly should Mr. Ford
listen to you?

00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:29.067
Because we've been
thinking wrong.

00:23:32.403 --> 00:23:33.505
Ferrari.

00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:37.208
Now, they have won four
out of the last five Le Mans.

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:40.545
We need to think like Ferrari.

00:23:41.112 --> 00:23:42.780
Ferrari makes
fewer cars

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:45.583
in a year
than we make in a day.

00:23:45.682 --> 00:23:48.520
We spend more
on toilet paper

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.089
than they do
on their entire output.

00:23:51.523 --> 00:23:53.791
You want us
to think like them?

00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:55.760
Enzo Ferrari will go down
in history

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.163
as the greatest
car manufacturer of all time.

00:23:59.531 --> 00:24:00.765
Why?

00:24:01.566 --> 00:24:04.701
Is it because he built
the most cars?

00:24:06.437 --> 00:24:07.704
No.

00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.408
It's because
of what his cars mean.

00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:13.011
Victory.

00:24:13.545 --> 00:24:15.113
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

00:24:15.213 --> 00:24:18.249
People, they, they want
some of that victory.

00:24:20.952 --> 00:24:24.088
What if the Ford badge
meant victory?

00:24:24.622 --> 00:24:25.890
And meant it
where it counts,

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.393
with the first group
of 17-year-olds in history

00:24:28.493 --> 00:24:29.727
with money in their pockets?

00:24:29.827 --> 00:24:31.529
This would take years.

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:34.165
Decades to test and develop...

00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:37.435
a race team capable
of taking out Ferrari.

00:24:37.535 --> 00:24:39.037
Ferrari's bankrupt.

00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:44.842
Enzo has spent every lira
he's got chasing perfection,

00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:46.244
and you know something?

00:24:46.344 --> 00:24:47.779
He got there.

00:24:48.246 --> 00:24:49.713
But now he's broke.

00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:15.440
You don't have
to give up racing

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.674
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

00:25:16.774 --> 00:25:17.775
I think I do.

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:19.010
Now, I've had my fun.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.279
It's time to put food
on the table...

00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:22.247
and grow up.

00:25:22.347 --> 00:25:23.648
The garage didn't pay
the bills.

00:25:23.748 --> 00:25:24.849
Now it's locked up.

00:25:24.949 --> 00:25:26.551
Racing doesn't
pay them either,

00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:27.685
and I keep winning.

00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:29.053
Yeah, because you're good.

00:25:29.153 --> 00:25:31.623
But I can't play the game.

00:25:32.023 --> 00:25:34.225
I'm not what they call
a people person.

00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.327
- You don't say.
- And I'm 45 years old.

00:25:36.427 --> 00:25:37.996
Do you really think
I'm gonna change?

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:40.932
I'm never gonna get
the good rise.

00:25:41.032 --> 00:25:42.133
I started too late.

00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:44.068
Because you fought
in the bloody war.

00:25:44.902 --> 00:25:49.140
If you stop,
you'll be bloody insufferable.

00:25:50.308 --> 00:25:53.444
Let's quit going round
the Wrekin. It's over.

00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:55.713
Let's look on the bright side.

00:25:55.813 --> 00:25:57.015
Now I can get fat and old,

00:25:57.115 --> 00:25:59.851
trim the roses,
and eat pork pies.

00:26:20.605 --> 00:26:22.173
Uh, <i>scusa.</i>

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.075
Please, no photos.

00:26:24.175 --> 00:26:25.143
<i>Prego.</i>

00:26:25.243 --> 00:26:26.978
- Relax, will you?
- You gotta understand.

00:26:27.278 --> 00:26:28.680
This is like the Mafia
showing up

00:26:28.781 --> 00:26:30.114
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:31.449
Kind of
the opposite, actually.

00:26:31.816 --> 00:26:35.119
The press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

00:26:35.653 --> 00:26:37.522
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

00:26:37.622 --> 00:26:39.357
Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:42.761
Journalists?

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.696
No, no, Mr. Iacocca, no.

00:26:44.797 --> 00:26:46.364
It's our cameras.

00:26:46.464 --> 00:26:47.865
Just for history.

00:26:50.736 --> 00:26:52.704
Four-liter Colombo engine.

00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:56.841
One man assembles
the entire engine

00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:58.276
by himself.

00:26:59.977 --> 00:27:03.081
Another man assembles
the transmission.

00:27:03.981 --> 00:27:05.550
Everything hand-built.

00:27:06.918 --> 00:27:08.152
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

00:27:21.632 --> 00:27:23.267
Racing Department.

00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:25.738
Lee.

00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:27.138
That's him.

00:27:32.276 --> 00:27:34.379
This merger
between our companies

00:27:34.479 --> 00:27:35.848
will form two entities.

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:40.651
Ford-Ferrari,

00:27:40.753 --> 00:27:42.220
90 percent owned by Ford,

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.789
who controls all production.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.130
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford,
the race team,

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.198
90 percent owned by Ferrari.

00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:03.541
In order to secure this,
Ford will pay the sum...

00:28:31.536 --> 00:28:32.970
Excuse me.

00:28:37.475 --> 00:28:39.745
He will need
some time to read this.

00:28:39.845 --> 00:28:41.412
Ah. Please.

00:28:43.648 --> 00:28:46.117
Ah. Yeah, of course.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.072
I'm looking for the chairman of Fiat!

00:29:08.172 --> 00:29:10.308
Agnelli!

00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:13.344
I have photographs for you to see.

00:29:20.485 --> 00:29:21.519
<i>Pronto.</i>

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.254
<i>Pronto.</i>

00:29:23.354 --> 00:29:24.589
Yes, I am here.

00:29:27.793 --> 00:29:28.993
Do you have something to say?

00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:32.530
Enzo maintains full control.

00:29:34.031 --> 00:29:36.334
I get the company for 18 million.

00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.671
All done, thank you.

00:29:56.187 --> 00:29:57.188
"Gentlemen,

00:29:57.288 --> 00:29:58.356
"only one small question.

00:29:58.456 --> 00:29:59.758
It concerns my race program."

00:30:09.534 --> 00:30:12.036
"If I wish to race Le Mans,

00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:14.272
"and you do not wish
for me to race Le Mans...

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.440
"do we or do we not go?"

00:30:24.315 --> 00:30:28.319
Look, in that
highly unlikely scenario...

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:31.656
if we just can't agree...

00:30:32.123 --> 00:30:34.158
then, yes.
I mean, no.

00:30:35.192 --> 00:30:36.694
You are correct.

00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:38.764
You do not go.

00:30:56.782 --> 00:30:58.316
"My integrity as a constructor,

00:30:58.416 --> 00:30:59.885

"is deeply insulted
by your proposal."

00:31:03.254 --> 00:31:04.823
"Go back to Michigan."

00:31:09.327 --> 00:31:11.063
"Back to your
big, ugly factory."

00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:15.000

"making its ugly, little cars."

"Tell your pigheaded boss that

00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:31.248
"all his, uh, smug executives
are worthless sons of whores."

00:31:33.651 --> 00:31:36.454
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.792
He's Henry Ford II.

00:31:43.729 --> 00:31:45.396
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:09.788
He played us.

00:32:10.521 --> 00:32:12.958
Old Man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:16.828
He used us to up his price...

00:32:17.361 --> 00:32:19.965
embarrass our company
and insult your leadership.

00:32:20.631 --> 00:32:22.801
It was a bad idea
from the start.

00:32:31.475 --> 00:32:33.577
What exactly did he say?

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:43.320
He said Ford makes
ugly little cars,

00:32:43.421 --> 00:32:44.790
and we make 'em...

00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:47.224
in an ugly factory.

00:32:48.827 --> 00:32:52.430
He said our executives
are sons of whores.

00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:57.468
About me?

00:32:59.303 --> 00:33:00.872
He called you fat, sir.

00:33:03.875 --> 00:33:05.209
Pigheaded.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.645
Go on.

00:33:08.646 --> 00:33:10.749
He said you're not Henry Ford.

00:33:11.817 --> 00:33:13.484
You're Henry Ford II.

00:33:35.974 --> 00:33:39.376
I want the best engineers.

00:33:41.245 --> 00:33:42.748
The best drivers.

00:33:45.117 --> 00:33:46.885
I don't care what it costs.

00:33:50.222 --> 00:33:51.990
We're gonna build a race car.

00:33:58.562 --> 00:33:59.765
And we're gonna bury

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:01.265
that goddamn greasy wop

00:34:01.365 --> 00:34:02.700
100 feet deep

00:34:02.801 --> 00:34:05.302
under the finish line
at Le Mans.

00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:09.340
And I will be there
to watch it.

00:34:10.142 --> 00:34:12.077
Here they come.
Go, go, go, go.

00:34:16.081 --> 00:34:17.048
Assholes.

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:18.250
You're really pathetic.

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:19.251
I'm so sorry, girls.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.651
Charlie!

00:34:20.752 --> 00:34:22.854
Quit throwing crackers
at the girls all damn day.

00:34:22.954 --> 00:34:24.122
God damn it.

00:34:24.222 --> 00:34:25.257
Do I gotta deal with this?

00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:26.892
It's already taken care of.

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:32.264
Sorry about that.
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

00:34:32.363 --> 00:34:33.497
Far out.

00:34:33.597 --> 00:34:35.432
Extensive rework
of AC Ace's front end.

00:34:35.533 --> 00:34:37.501
And a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:39.171
How's she handle
a quarter mile?

00:34:39.637 --> 00:34:41.973
Well, now, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing,

00:34:42.073 --> 00:34:43.507
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

00:34:43.607 --> 00:34:44.810
Yeah.

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.443
- Is that good?
- Oh, that's real good.

00:34:46.544 --> 00:34:49.513
He sold that same car
three times this week.

00:34:49.613 --> 00:34:51.750
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:54.186
Yeah, mister, you just bought
yourself one hell of a sport car.

00:34:54.286 --> 00:34:55.653
All right.

00:34:56.822 --> 00:34:59.257
Tell you what,
I'm gonna... Phil!

00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:00.624
I'm gonna pass you off
to my colleague here.

00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.027
He gonna take care of you.

00:35:02.127 --> 00:35:03.829
- Phil, Wyatt.
- Hello, Wyatt.

00:35:03.929 --> 00:35:05.396
I'm gonna steal him
for one second.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.799
You take the payment.

00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:09.567
Whatever you do,
do not let him take that car.

00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:10.836
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

00:35:10.936 --> 00:35:13.104
And Frank Collins'
and Steve McQueen's.

00:35:13.205 --> 00:35:15.406
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

00:35:18.342 --> 00:35:19.577
Morning.

00:35:20.111 --> 00:35:21.345
Can I help you?

00:35:22.446 --> 00:35:23.748
Carroll Shelby?

00:35:24.883 --> 00:35:25.917
Maybe.

00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:29.821
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.625
What's with the wrench?

00:35:35.126 --> 00:35:36.995
That? Oh, long story.

00:35:37.796 --> 00:35:40.866
We are just going from strength
to strength here, Lee.

00:35:41.398 --> 00:35:44.069
Terrific sales,
we're killing it on the track.

00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:45.569
Now, I know I owe Ford

00:35:45.669 --> 00:35:46.670
for that last batch
of engines...

00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:48.306
Mr. Shelby,
I can assure you

00:35:48.405 --> 00:35:49.506
I'm not here for money

00:35:49.607 --> 00:35:51.743
that you might owe Ford
for spare parts.

00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:54.478
You're not?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.580
No, I'm not.

00:35:57.414 --> 00:35:58.682
Okay.

00:35:58.783 --> 00:36:01.452
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford II.

00:36:01.552 --> 00:36:04.222
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

00:36:04.322 --> 00:36:06.291
that he wanted his company

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.525
to win the 24 Hours
of Le Mans.

00:36:09.593 --> 00:36:10.996
You're one
of the only Americans

00:36:11.096 --> 00:36:12.529
that's ever done it...

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.032
so I'm wondering...

00:36:14.933 --> 00:36:16.067
what's it take?

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.805
Hypothetically?

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.174
Hypothetically.

00:36:24.508 --> 00:36:26.477
It takes something
money can't buy.

00:36:27.544 --> 00:36:29.014
Money can buy speed.

00:36:30.547 --> 00:36:32.416
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

00:36:33.385 --> 00:36:35.020
It's not just like
those other tracks

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.455
where all you do is turn
to the left for four hours.

00:36:40.859 --> 00:36:42.193
To win that race,
you need a car

00:36:42.294 --> 00:36:44.595
that's light enough to do 200
on the straightaways

00:36:44.695 --> 00:36:45.830
but strong enough
to keep that up

00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:47.999
for 3,000 miles
without a break.

00:36:50.035 --> 00:36:51.770
Not just the best car

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.671
y'all have ever made,
but better than anything

00:36:53.772 --> 00:36:55.673
that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

00:36:55.774 --> 00:36:57.474
And that just gets you
to the green flag.

00:36:57.574 --> 00:36:59.543
That's where your problems
really start.

00:37:01.512 --> 00:37:03.148
Is everything okay?

00:37:03.248 --> 00:37:05.216
Go away.

00:37:12.556 --> 00:37:14.558
So you're saying
it's challenging.

00:37:16.928 --> 00:37:19.097
Look, it's not even
a track, Lee.

00:37:19.764 --> 00:37:22.100
Le Mans is eight and a half
miles of country road.

00:37:23.435 --> 00:37:26.704
It's narrow, ungraded,
it's rough.

00:37:26.805 --> 00:37:29.874
There's no camber
on the turns, no rails.

00:37:32.476 --> 00:37:34.245
You gotta do that
for 24 hours.

00:37:36.147 --> 00:37:37.614
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:40.718
That means night.

00:37:41.252 --> 00:37:44.488
Half that race is in the dark.
You can't see shit.

00:37:46.024 --> 00:37:48.126
Cars coming up on you
out of nowhere.

00:37:49.593 --> 00:37:52.663
Drivers stumbling around
the track, pouring blood.

00:37:53.465 --> 00:37:55.266
Maybe one of 'em
is your friend. Maybe...

00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:57.701
Maybe he's on fire.

00:37:59.437 --> 00:38:01.373
You're exhausted,
you're hungry...

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.476
can't remember your name,
what country you're in.

00:38:05.343 --> 00:38:08.947
And all of a sudden, you realize
you're doing 198 on a straight.

00:38:12.683 --> 00:38:14.252
And if anything goes wrong...

00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:18.056
you blow a gasket,
a five-cent washer...

00:38:18.555 --> 00:38:20.225
that's it, whole thing's over.

00:38:21.259 --> 00:38:22.559
Ferrari wins again.

00:38:23.395 --> 00:38:25.964
Just like he won last year
and the year before that.

00:38:26.297 --> 00:38:27.732
And the year before that.

00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:32.703
Yeah.

00:38:33.304 --> 00:38:34.538
It's challenging.

00:38:35.774 --> 00:38:37.175
So you don't think...

00:38:37.876 --> 00:38:39.210
that Ford Motor Company
can build

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.545
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

00:38:41.645 --> 00:38:44.182
You think that
we are incapable

00:38:44.516 --> 00:38:46.017
of winning an event like that?

00:38:46.418 --> 00:38:48.619
Even if we had
a brilliant partner?

00:38:51.356 --> 00:38:54.959
Even if we wrote a, uh,
blank check?

00:39:01.299 --> 00:39:04.635
What I'm saying is,
you can't buy a win, Lee.

00:39:07.405 --> 00:39:11.276
But maybe you could buy
the guy who gets you a shot.

00:39:28.293 --> 00:39:32.764
A new transmission, axles,
shocks all around,

00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:36.167
ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

00:39:37.235 --> 00:39:39.437
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:42.207
The mirrors are outstanding.

00:39:42.307 --> 00:39:43.541
I saw that walking up.

00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:48.645
So, what, you just passing
on an evening stroll?

00:39:49.347 --> 00:39:51.983
Actually, Bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:56.221
You're gonna build a car
to beat Old Man Ferrari...

00:39:56.321 --> 00:39:58.089
- Yeah.
- ...with Ford?

00:39:58.189 --> 00:40:00.325
With a Ford?

00:40:00.425 --> 00:40:01.692
Correct.

00:40:01.793 --> 00:40:03.627
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

00:40:03.728 --> 00:40:05.396
Two, three hundred years?

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.998
Ninety days.

00:40:10.969 --> 00:40:13.938
All right, so let's just look
at this for a moment.

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:16.174
And for argument's sake,

00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:18.743
let's just forget about
the whole 90-day thing.

00:40:18.843 --> 00:40:20.478
So let's just pretend you've got
all the money in the world

00:40:20.578 --> 00:40:22.614
and all the time in the world.

00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:24.415
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

00:40:24.516 --> 00:40:25.583
So...

00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:29.087
you think that Ford
are gonna let you build

00:40:29.888 --> 00:40:32.723
the car that you want...

00:40:33.258 --> 00:40:34.792
the way you want it?

00:40:34.893 --> 00:40:37.896
The Ford Motor Company?

00:40:39.097 --> 00:40:40.231
Those guys?

00:40:41.466 --> 00:40:42.600
Have you ever been to Detroit?

00:40:42.699 --> 00:40:45.637
They have floors
and floors of lawyers

00:40:45.737 --> 00:40:47.572
and millions
of marketing guys,

00:40:47.671 --> 00:40:48.806
and they're all gonna want
to meet you.

00:40:48.907 --> 00:40:50.375
They're gonna want
to get their photo taken

00:40:50.475 --> 00:40:51.543
with the great
Carroll Shelby,

00:40:51.643 --> 00:40:52.777
and they're gonna
kiss your ass

00:40:52.877 --> 00:40:54.245
and go back
to their lovely offices...

00:40:54.879 --> 00:40:56.915
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

00:40:57.015 --> 00:40:59.683
Why? Because
they can't help it.

00:40:59.784 --> 00:41:01.319
Because they just want
to please their boss

00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:04.756
who wants please his boss
who wants to please his boss.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.592
And they hate themselves
for it.

00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:09.394
But deep down...

00:41:09.494 --> 00:41:11.396
who they hate even more

00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:12.664
are guys like you,

00:41:12.764 --> 00:41:14.032
because you're not like them,

00:41:14.132 --> 00:41:15.767
because you don't think
like them,

00:41:15.867 --> 00:41:17.902
because you're different.

00:41:19.137 --> 00:41:21.072
It's coming straight
from the Deuce.

00:41:23.575 --> 00:41:24.676
He's serious.

00:41:24.976 --> 00:41:26.177
They're gonna put
real money behind it.

00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:31.115
I'll bet they are.

00:41:32.283 --> 00:41:33.518
You know why?

00:41:33.618 --> 00:41:36.020
Because someone,
and I'm not saying who,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:42.093
someone has told them that
this is actually possible.

00:41:42.427 --> 00:41:43.461
Look...

00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:45.096
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

00:41:45.196 --> 00:41:46.564
they're launching
the new Mustang.

00:41:46.664 --> 00:41:48.299
They're gonna announce
the race program.

00:41:49.567 --> 00:41:50.868
Just come on by.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.773
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

00:41:56.307 --> 00:41:57.275
I'm making a speech.

00:41:57.675 --> 00:41:59.811
Bring Peter. He'll love it.

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:03.248
All right, Shel.

00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:07.085
See you Sunday.

00:42:10.288 --> 00:42:11.756
Whoa.

00:42:12.357 --> 00:42:15.226
Dad, look at that.

00:42:16.327 --> 00:42:17.495
Huh.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.499
The Ford Mustang.
What do you think?

00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:26.971
I think
it's a secretary's car.

00:42:28.673 --> 00:42:30.108
I like it.

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:32.745
Oh.

00:42:32.844 --> 00:42:34.545
Excu... Excuse me.

00:42:36.247 --> 00:42:37.982
Would you,
would you not do that?

00:42:38.516 --> 00:42:40.518
Oh. Sorry.

00:42:43.721 --> 00:42:46.391
Oh, er, is this,
is this your son?

00:42:47.258 --> 00:42:48.459
Yes, it is.

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:51.229
Would you ask him to keep
his hands off the paintwork?

00:42:51.764 --> 00:42:52.797
No, no, no, Peter.

00:42:52.897 --> 00:42:54.265
You're okay.
Who are you?

00:42:54.767 --> 00:42:57.702
Leo Beebe, senior executive vice
president, Ford Motor Company.

00:42:57.802 --> 00:42:58.803
Ah.

00:42:58.903 --> 00:43:00.138
I'm responsible for the launch

00:43:00.238 --> 00:43:01.005
of the Mustang.

00:43:01.105 --> 00:43:02.741
Ah! At least now we know

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.875
who's responsible.

00:43:03.975 --> 00:43:04.976
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

00:43:05.076 --> 00:43:07.979
- Leo.
- It looks fantastic.

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:10.014
But inside,
it's a lump of lard

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:11.449
dressed up to fool the public.

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:13.484
My advice is,

00:43:13.584 --> 00:43:14.986
lose the inline-six

00:43:15.086 --> 00:43:16.721
and that idiotic
three-speed,

00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:20.391
shorten the wheelbase,
somehow lose half a ton,

00:43:20.491 --> 00:43:21.659
and lower the price.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.728
Dad.

00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:23.895
But even then,

00:43:23.995 --> 00:43:25.563
I'd still choose
a Chevy Chevelle.

00:43:26.664 --> 00:43:29.334
And that's
a fucking terrible car.

00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:32.337
<i>How are we doing
up there, Steve?</i>

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.539
There's Cloverfield,
Mr. Shelby.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.674
Oh, yeah.

00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:39.177
You mind if I take
a shot at the landing?

00:43:39.277 --> 00:43:40.445
Uh...

00:43:40.545 --> 00:43:41.679
No, no, no. I mean it.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.614
I flew B-29s
out of San Antone in '44.

00:43:43.715 --> 00:43:44.949
You're kidding.

00:43:45.316 --> 00:43:46.884
- I did.
- Okay.

00:43:46.984 --> 00:43:48.152
Carroll, what are you doing?

00:43:48.252 --> 00:43:49.788
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

00:43:49.887 --> 00:43:52.457
I had an instructor tell me,
he said...

00:43:52.557 --> 00:43:54.926
Don, I would say it's probably
a good time to buckle up.

00:43:55.026 --> 00:43:57.095
"...do everybody a favor,
stay on the ground."

00:43:58.096 --> 00:43:59.497
That's a true story.

00:43:59.597 --> 00:44:00.766
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

00:44:00.865 --> 00:44:02.567
- God damn it.
- Here we go.

00:44:02.667 --> 00:44:03.802
<i>This is the car</i>

00:44:03.901 --> 00:44:05.804
<i>you never expected
from Detroit.</i>

00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:11.476
All right. Let's go.

00:44:13.378 --> 00:44:14.780
Not staying, Ken?

00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:17.750
Ah, it's a bloody pig
in a poke, isn't it?

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.050
Oh, here they come now.

00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:26.524
- Wait. Are they crashing?
- Oh, Lord.

00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:27.992
Who's the pilot?

00:44:28.092 --> 00:44:30.027
My guess, Peter...

00:44:33.097 --> 00:44:34.499
it's someone we know.

00:44:35.868 --> 00:44:37.168
<i>Everything all right
up there?</i>

00:44:37.736 --> 00:44:39.103
Oh, no.

00:44:39.203 --> 00:44:40.538
- No!
- Hang on.

00:44:40.638 --> 00:44:43.074
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

00:44:43.174 --> 00:44:46.745
Shit. Shit. Shit.

00:44:46.845 --> 00:44:48.679
Tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

00:44:55.386 --> 00:44:56.822
Talk about making an entrance.

00:44:56.921 --> 00:44:58.689
- Shelby...
- Good grief.

00:44:58.791 --> 00:45:00.158
- Shelby!
- All right!

00:45:00.258 --> 00:45:02.460
- Over here. Over here!
- Shelby!

00:45:02.693 --> 00:45:03.896
How y'all doing?

00:45:03.995 --> 00:45:05.096
Can I get
your autograph, please?

00:45:05.196 --> 00:45:06.297
Can I get
your autograph, sir?

00:45:06.397 --> 00:45:07.866
Carroll,
this is Roy Lunn.

00:45:07.965 --> 00:45:09.133
Old Roy here is developing

00:45:09.233 --> 00:45:10.468
the prototype over in England.

00:45:10.568 --> 00:45:12.738
Oh, hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

00:45:12.838 --> 00:45:14.138
Welcome
to the madhouse, Shelby.

00:45:14.238 --> 00:45:15.774
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee

00:45:15.874 --> 00:45:16.842
for this one.

00:45:16.941 --> 00:45:18.376
Hold that thought.

00:45:18.877 --> 00:45:19.745
Ah.

00:45:19.845 --> 00:45:21.212
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

00:45:21.312 --> 00:45:23.749
You like that?
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:25.149
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

00:45:25.249 --> 00:45:27.552
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:31.155
Well, we're gonna go
to Le Mans, that's for sure.

00:45:31.255 --> 00:45:33.291
And if we get across that finish
line first, we're gonna win.

00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:35.293
Carroll, allow me
to introduce Leo Beebe,

00:45:35.393 --> 00:45:37.428
senior vice president,
Ford Motor.

00:45:37.528 --> 00:45:39.096
Oh, sure. Yeah.
A pleasure, Mr. Beebe.

00:45:39.197 --> 00:45:40.698
- Thank you for coming.
- Say hello to Ken Miles

00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:41.966
- and his son, Peter.
- Yeah.

00:45:42.066 --> 00:45:44.569
- We've, um... we met.
- We, uh... we met.

00:45:45.403 --> 00:45:46.571
Yeah.

00:45:47.104 --> 00:45:48.339
Didn't we?

00:45:48.439 --> 00:45:50.308
So, um, well...

00:45:50.776 --> 00:45:52.778
I'll take Petey for some pop.

00:45:53.377 --> 00:45:55.146
Good luck
with these guys, Shel.

00:45:55.246 --> 00:45:57.215
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

00:45:57.816 --> 00:45:59.417
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.254
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

00:46:04.155 --> 00:46:05.356
Yeah. Uh...

00:46:05.656 --> 00:46:08.626
Carroll, why don't we just
step this way for a second?

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:17.368
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

00:46:17.468 --> 00:46:19.136
But there's gotta be
a sense of give-and-take

00:46:19.237 --> 00:46:20.571
between you and...

00:46:20.671 --> 00:46:21.940
you know.

00:46:22.039 --> 00:46:23.007
No, I don't.

00:46:23.107 --> 00:46:24.342
The group.

00:46:24.442 --> 00:46:25.543
The group?

00:46:25.643 --> 00:46:26.577
Senior creatives, Carroll.

00:46:26.677 --> 00:46:29.146
Just to make sure
everybody's comfortable.

00:46:29.714 --> 00:46:30.816
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:32.450
'Cause up until
this moment, right now,

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.785
I was comfortable.

00:46:34.585 --> 00:46:36.855
You should take a look
out there, Carroll. Hmm?

00:46:36.955 --> 00:46:38.422
What do you see?

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:39.992
You know what I see?

00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:41.559
I see a machine.

00:46:41.659 --> 00:46:43.661
I see 10,000 moving parts,

00:46:43.762 --> 00:46:44.930
moving hopefully in harmony,

00:46:45.029 --> 00:46:46.464
and it's my job to make it so.

00:46:46.564 --> 00:46:48.000
It's my job
to guide you through it.

00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:50.034
I am here
to help you, Carroll.

00:46:50.134 --> 00:46:51.770
But you gotta trust me.

00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:54.006
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll...

00:46:54.672 --> 00:46:56.474
do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

00:46:56.574 --> 00:46:59.477
<i>Please welcome
Mr. Carroll Shelby.</i>

00:46:59.577 --> 00:47:00.979
Gotta go.

00:47:03.815 --> 00:47:06.250
Shelby... Oh.
Shelby.

00:47:07.718 --> 00:47:08.754
What'd he say?

00:47:08.854 --> 00:47:10.187
He gets the drill.

00:47:13.257 --> 00:47:15.126
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:47:15.226 --> 00:47:17.395
<i>Well, if my daddy
was here today...</i>

00:47:17.495 --> 00:47:19.163
<i>he'd tell me to sit on down</i>

00:47:19.263 --> 00:47:22.300
<i>and leave the yakking
to the college boys...</i>

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.569
<i>so, like my cars,
I'll make this fast.</i>

00:47:26.939 --> 00:47:29.640
<i>When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son...</i>

00:47:30.308 --> 00:47:32.176
<i>"it's a truly lucky man</i>

00:47:32.276 --> 00:47:34.478
<i>"who knows what he wants
to do in this world.</i>

00:47:34.579 --> 00:47:37.648
<i>"'Cause that man will
never work a day in his life."</i>

00:47:37.749 --> 00:47:40.384
<i>But there are a few,
a precious few,</i>

00:47:40.484 --> 00:47:42.620
<i>and, hell, I don't know
if they're lucky or not.</i>

00:47:43.454 --> 00:47:44.589
<i>But there are a few people</i>

00:47:44.689 --> 00:47:46.390
<i>who find something
they have to do.</i>

00:47:47.793 --> 00:47:49.427
<i>Something obsesses 'em.</i>

00:47:50.461 --> 00:47:52.229
<i>Something that
if they can't do it,</i>

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.332
<i>it's gonna drive them
clean out of their mind.</i>

00:47:55.366 --> 00:47:57.602
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

00:47:57.702 --> 00:48:00.504
<i>And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.</i>

00:48:02.007 --> 00:48:03.274
<i>His name...</i>

00:48:05.509 --> 00:48:07.378
<i>His name is Mr. Henry Ford.</i>

00:48:07.478 --> 00:48:10.114
Yeah! Whoo!

00:48:12.084 --> 00:48:13.752
<i>And together,
we're gonna build</i>

00:48:13.852 --> 00:48:15.821
<i>the fastest automobiles
in the world.</i>

00:48:19.024 --> 00:48:21.827
<i>And we're gonna make history,
too, at Le Mans.</i>

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.465
- Let's go.
- What?

00:48:27.565 --> 00:48:29.367
<i>My name is Carroll Shelby.</i>

00:48:30.068 --> 00:48:31.602
<i>I build race cars.</i>

00:48:54.993 --> 00:48:56.795
No. Whatever it is, no.

00:48:59.031 --> 00:49:00.231
No.

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:02.134
Thirty minutes.

00:49:02.433 --> 00:49:05.269
Ah, just... I'm spent.

00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:07.873
- I wanna have a bath.
- You're gonna wanna see this.

00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:09.875
Trust me.

00:49:10.876 --> 00:49:13.711
Thirty minutes. I'll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.

00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:18.083
Thirty minutes.

00:49:18.182 --> 00:49:19.617
Yeah.

00:49:38.036 --> 00:49:39.570
Bloody hell.

00:49:45.409 --> 00:49:47.145
Fresh off the plane
from England.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.217
Now, she's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

00:50:02.693 --> 00:50:04.228
Whoa! Come on.

00:50:16.808 --> 00:50:18.342
Interesting.

00:50:35.127 --> 00:50:36.061
Well?

00:50:36.161 --> 00:50:37.394
It's awful.

00:50:37.495 --> 00:50:38.897
It's worse than awful.

00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:40.297
Yeah, it doesn't track.

00:50:40.397 --> 00:50:42.768
You know,
the third gear is too high.

00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:46.270
Torque is not reaching
the road.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:50.274
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

00:50:50.374 --> 00:50:52.778
And over 140,
it thinks it's a...

00:50:52.878 --> 00:50:53.812
Airplane.

00:50:53.912 --> 00:50:55.113
Yeah.

00:50:55.213 --> 00:50:57.448
It wants to lift off
and fly to Hawaii.

00:51:00.152 --> 00:51:01.452
Anything else?

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:08.692
One sec.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.292
You were back late last night.

00:51:40.391 --> 00:51:41.659
Yeah.

00:51:45.263 --> 00:51:47.732
- Were you working?
- Mmm.

00:51:51.136 --> 00:51:52.636
So, you didn't go anyplace?

00:51:53.704 --> 00:51:54.940
What?

00:51:56.707 --> 00:51:58.977
Well, I'm asking, did you
go anyplace last night?

00:52:01.679 --> 00:52:02.881
Mollie.

00:52:03.181 --> 00:52:04.783
It's a simple question.

00:52:07.118 --> 00:52:08.753
And I answered, didn't I?

00:52:09.154 --> 00:52:10.554
What was the answer?

00:52:12.389 --> 00:52:13.624
Is something up, love?

00:52:15.961 --> 00:52:17.295
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:52:17.394 --> 00:52:19.130
You're driving very fast.

00:52:19.231 --> 00:52:20.332
Oh, am I? Am I?

00:52:20.431 --> 00:52:21.733
Yes, you are.

00:52:23.969 --> 00:52:25.871
Bloody hell! What are you...
The hell is this?

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:28.139
Well, you tell me,
'cause I don't know.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.275
Right, slow down!

00:52:30.374 --> 00:52:32.143
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mollie!

00:52:34.678 --> 00:52:36.915
Please slow it down,
all right?

00:52:37.015 --> 00:52:38.817
You trying to kill us
or something?

00:52:38.917 --> 00:52:40.919
- Well, I thought we love this shit.
- What?

00:52:42.821 --> 00:52:45.389
- Bloody hell!
- It's a bit of racing fun. No?

00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:46.758
No, no, no.
It's not the same at all.

00:52:46.858 --> 00:52:48.994
Well, I think it's thrilling!

00:52:49.493 --> 00:52:50.962
All right.

00:52:51.062 --> 00:52:52.764
Look, I saw you, all right?

00:52:53.999 --> 00:52:56.400
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.169
Okay. Shit.
Okay, but slow it...

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:00.805
And then all day you've got
that stupid look on your face.

00:53:00.906 --> 00:53:03.141
Mollie, slow down.
You're too close here.

00:53:05.877 --> 00:53:08.479
Mollie, put on the brakes
right now...

00:53:08.579 --> 00:53:10.681
Not until you tell me
what's going on!

00:53:10.782 --> 00:53:13.218
All right.
I went to look at a car.

00:53:13.318 --> 00:53:15.186
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

00:53:15.287 --> 00:53:17.488
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:20.524
There's a corner coming.
You'd better hold on.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.495
Oh! Are you gonna lift your
foot off at all through this?

00:53:24.595 --> 00:53:26.164
No, 'cause I like
a clean racing line.

00:53:26.264 --> 00:53:27.299
Slow down!

00:53:31.303 --> 00:53:32.203
Okay.

00:53:32.304 --> 00:53:33.805
Shel offered me a job.

00:53:33.905 --> 00:53:37.242
Ford has a car that they want
to put up against a Ferrari.

00:53:37.342 --> 00:53:39.210
- You told me you were done.
- That's it. Now, slow...

00:53:39.311 --> 00:53:40.845
I didn't say yes.

00:53:40.946 --> 00:53:42.247
Slow down.

00:53:42.347 --> 00:53:43.915
You told me you quit.

00:53:44.883 --> 00:53:47.419
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old, you said.

00:53:47.518 --> 00:53:49.120
Fat and old.

00:53:53.024 --> 00:53:54.525
- I don't understand.
- That's what you told me.

00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:56.328
I don't understand.

00:53:56.428 --> 00:53:57.862
Are you upset
because I said I was done

00:53:57.963 --> 00:54:00.765
or because
I looked at a race car?

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.769
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

00:54:06.204 --> 00:54:07.806
Don't make it a secret,

00:54:07.906 --> 00:54:09.207
what you want
or what you feel,

00:54:09.307 --> 00:54:12.243
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy.

00:54:14.346 --> 00:54:16.580
Moll, I don't even know
what I feel.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.123
If you do this...

00:54:27.792 --> 00:54:30.061
then he better be
paying you this time.

00:54:32.197 --> 00:54:35.233
'Cause I can't work any more
hours and look after Peter.

00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:36.667
You know,
the IRS have the garage.

00:54:36.768 --> 00:54:39.037
I'm not losing my home.

00:54:39.636 --> 00:54:41.572
It's 200 a day.

00:54:44.242 --> 00:54:45.877
Plus expenses.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.948
Are you shitting me?

00:54:50.315 --> 00:54:52.649
But I haven't decided.

00:54:55.353 --> 00:54:56.955
$200 a day?

00:54:59.523 --> 00:55:00.859
Are you nuts?

00:55:24.182 --> 00:55:27.285
Look at this.
This is ridiculous. Here.

00:55:27.385 --> 00:55:30.422
So, Shel, grabbing air.

00:55:30.522 --> 00:55:32.057
That's the problem.

00:55:32.757 --> 00:55:36.428
Over 90, air's getting in,
not getting out.

00:55:36.528 --> 00:55:38.430
It's the nose,
I can feel it in the wheel.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.596
Mr. Miles,
if there's a problem,

00:55:39.696 --> 00:55:40.732
the computer will find it.

00:55:40.832 --> 00:55:42.000
- All right.
- Charlie,

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.635
get some Scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

00:55:45.569 --> 00:55:47.739
All right. Good, good, good.

00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:51.642
So, now let's just, uh,
get all of this junk out.

00:55:51.743 --> 00:55:52.777
Right, Pops?

00:55:52.877 --> 00:55:54.245
Yeah, yeah. I concur.

00:55:54.345 --> 00:55:55.712
Come on, guys.

00:55:57.982 --> 00:55:59.217
What are they doing?

00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:01.352
Making your car faster.

00:56:09.127 --> 00:56:10.228
There. Right there.

00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:11.595
Airflow's getting stuck.

00:56:14.598 --> 00:56:17.435
I see it.
Yarn blows straight up.

00:56:17.535 --> 00:56:19.003
- Yep.
- The front's lifting.

00:56:19.104 --> 00:56:20.738
Damn, he's right.

00:56:31.216 --> 00:56:34.552
This car wants to go faster.
I feel it.

00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:36.554
Any lighter,
we're getting fragile.

00:56:37.021 --> 00:56:38.923
Took 70 pounds out of her
in the last week.

00:56:39.023 --> 00:56:41.826
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:44.095
So put in a bigger engine.

00:56:44.195 --> 00:56:45.997
Where we gonna put it?
On the roof?

00:56:48.933 --> 00:56:50.602
Managed to make it
52 pounds lighter

00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:52.669
than the NASCAR unit.

00:56:57.108 --> 00:56:59.577
All-new aluminum
cylinder heads...

00:57:00.245 --> 00:57:03.448
vibration dampeners,
water pump, smaller valves.

00:57:03.781 --> 00:57:05.283
We call it the Beast.

00:57:05.917 --> 00:57:07.218
Yeah, I can see why,

00:57:07.318 --> 00:57:08.419
but how's it gonna fit

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.488
without a redesign
of the engine bed?

00:57:10.588 --> 00:57:11.688
Well, it certainly
wasn't easy.

00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:12.957
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Shelby.

00:57:13.057 --> 00:57:17.195
So, you already put that
in a GT40?

00:57:17.495 --> 00:57:19.696
I'm afraid we have.

00:57:25.303 --> 00:57:26.838
I'll be damned.

00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:28.773
Well, it's heavy, of course.

00:57:28.873 --> 00:57:30.141
Problems with the handling,
especially the stopping.

00:57:30.241 --> 00:57:32.377
- I can show you the data.
- What problems?

00:57:32.477 --> 00:57:33.611
Understeers a little, but...

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:35.313
Can I borrow that?

00:57:35.413 --> 00:57:36.614
Just a second. Thank you.

00:57:36.713 --> 00:57:37.615
Ken!

00:57:38.416 --> 00:57:41.619
Ken, perhaps you want to check
with HQ before you test...

00:57:41.718 --> 00:57:43.087
What did he say?

00:57:43.188 --> 00:57:44.355
We should ask...

00:57:44.455 --> 00:57:45.689
Right.

00:57:47.859 --> 00:57:50.995
Oh, yes!

00:57:58.136 --> 00:58:00.638
Mr. Shelby,
welcome to Dearborn.

00:58:00.738 --> 00:58:02.106
What are you doing
at a test track?

00:58:02.207 --> 00:58:04.442
You're gonna get Castrol oil
all over that nice suit.

00:58:04.542 --> 00:58:05.810
Ah, I wanted to hear
your thoughts

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:07.011
on a few planning decisions.

00:58:07.111 --> 00:58:08.680
You know,
personnel for Le Mans.

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.215
Well,
it's a hell of a lineup.

00:58:10.315 --> 00:58:12.050
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:13.918
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

00:58:14.018 --> 00:58:16.487
Hill's a lock.
Amon, McLaren, too.

00:58:16.588 --> 00:58:18.323
We're less sure about Miles.

00:58:18.423 --> 00:58:19.757
We like Richie Ginther...

00:58:20.158 --> 00:58:22.727
Masten Gregory,
Bob Bondurant.

00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:25.463
Well, you're gonna want
the best driver for the car.

00:58:25.563 --> 00:58:27.165
Understands the machine.

00:58:27.265 --> 00:58:28.566
That's Ken.

00:58:28.666 --> 00:58:30.568
Oh! Yes!

00:58:31.302 --> 00:58:34.772
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

00:58:34.872 --> 00:58:37.208
I may not get the finer points
of racing, Mr. Shelby,

00:58:37.308 --> 00:58:38.776
but I do know people.

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.278
Miles is a...

00:58:40.712 --> 00:58:43.348
Well, he's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

00:58:44.048 --> 00:58:45.483
Ford means reliability.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.986
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

00:58:48.086 --> 00:58:49.721
Whoa!

00:58:49.821 --> 00:58:51.856
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

00:58:54.993 --> 00:58:57.128
What's the lap record
here, Burt?

00:58:57.228 --> 00:58:59.130
1:58.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.466
- 1:50 dead.
- <i>A beatnik?</i>

00:59:01.566 --> 00:59:04.302
That man landed a busted tank
on the beach at D-Day

00:59:04.402 --> 00:59:06.804
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

00:59:07.472 --> 00:59:08.873
A beatnik?

00:59:08.973 --> 00:59:10.308
You know, Lee here asked me
a while back,

00:59:10.408 --> 00:59:12.410
"What's the one thing
money can't buy?"

00:59:13.144 --> 00:59:14.445
I'll tell you what it is.

00:59:14.912 --> 00:59:17.115
A pure racer
behind the wheel of your car.

00:59:17.915 --> 00:59:19.417
That's Ken Miles.

00:59:20.985 --> 00:59:22.820
Well, be that as it may...

00:59:23.655 --> 00:59:25.456
we think he may be too pure.

00:59:33.331 --> 00:59:36.901
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

00:59:38.202 --> 00:59:39.404
"Too pure"?

00:59:40.138 --> 00:59:41.973
What exactly does that mean?

00:59:42.607 --> 00:59:44.108
It means
he's all about himself.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:47.879
ABC puts a microphone
under his nose,

00:59:47.979 --> 00:59:50.315
perhaps there's a detail
he dislikes,

00:59:50.415 --> 00:59:51.549
millions watching...

00:59:51.649 --> 00:59:53.786
do you trust him not to
put out the wrong message?

00:59:53.885 --> 00:59:55.386
Well, look, you can get
a clean-cut,

00:59:55.486 --> 00:59:56.587
all-American poster boy

00:59:56.688 --> 00:59:57.722
and stick him
behind the wheel,

00:59:57.822 --> 00:59:59.057
teach him what to say.

00:59:59.157 --> 01:00:00.825
Shit, you get Doris Day
to drive the car,

01:00:00.925 --> 01:00:02.160
if all you want to do is lose.

01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:05.830
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:10.201
I'm saying you gotta trust me
on this one.

01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:12.036
Carroll,
with marketing concerns,

01:00:12.136 --> 01:00:13.571
that's just not possible.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.943
Put a Ford-type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

01:00:19.644 --> 01:00:21.179
That's the Ford way.

01:00:27.685 --> 01:00:29.921
<i>Yet another
championship win for Ferrari</i>

01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:31.723
<i>as British driver John Surtees</i>

01:00:31.824 --> 01:00:33.491
<i>pilots his Ferrari 312...</i>

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.193
Ferrari wins.

01:00:35.293 --> 01:00:37.862
<i>It's Surtees'
first win since the '64...</i>

01:00:37.962 --> 01:00:39.765
Wedges. We have wedges.

01:00:39.864 --> 01:00:41.834
Oh, good, good, good.

01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:43.267
Perfect.

01:00:44.068 --> 01:00:46.070
- 40?
- Yep.

01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:56.481
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Dan.

01:00:56.581 --> 01:00:58.950
- Boss, Ferrari just bagged...
- You got a passport?

01:00:59.050 --> 01:00:59.984
What's that?

01:01:00.084 --> 01:01:01.854
Sign that. Get a passport.

01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:03.721
Get it back to me
by Friday. Frosty.

01:01:03.822 --> 01:01:05.089
Boys, I'm going to France.

01:01:07.258 --> 01:01:08.559
Phil.

01:01:08.659 --> 01:01:10.261
Ken, can I get a word?

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:17.935
Oh.

01:01:19.036 --> 01:01:20.505
Can I take this?

01:01:20.605 --> 01:01:21.706
Hey.

01:01:22.073 --> 01:01:25.143
Do you know why Ford named it
the GT40?

01:01:25.243 --> 01:01:27.145
Why they put that "40"
on there?

01:01:27.245 --> 01:01:29.180
- No.
- Regulations. All right?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.850
We gotta be 40 inches high

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:34.685
to make the ground
clearance requirements.

01:01:34.787 --> 01:01:35.854
No more, no less.

01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:37.355
They measure it
before every race.

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:40.391
Problem is,
that with that height,

01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:43.561
there's too much drag
under the car, all right?

01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:45.263
So, we have a solution.

01:01:45.363 --> 01:01:47.064
Wedges. We put wedges
in the suspension...

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:49.033
You're not coming next week.

01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:53.137
You're not coming, Ken.

01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:59.243
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

01:02:00.445 --> 01:02:01.712
and Bob Bondurant.

01:02:02.513 --> 01:02:04.148
It's Ford's call.

01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:07.853
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

01:02:07.952 --> 01:02:10.254
so you cannot drive
their race car.

01:02:11.556 --> 01:02:13.224
And putting aside the fact
that you made that car

01:02:13.324 --> 01:02:14.692
whatever the hell it is...

01:02:15.393 --> 01:02:18.396
and you're the best man
I got behind the wheel...

01:02:38.149 --> 01:02:40.051
I'm gonna reroute
the oil line.

01:02:40.151 --> 01:02:41.954
If there's spillage,
it could drip

01:02:42.053 --> 01:02:43.789
onto the rear nearside disc.

01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:44.989
Ken...

01:02:45.089 --> 01:02:46.157
Tell the boys

01:02:46.257 --> 01:02:50.328
to watch their pace
come sunrise.

01:02:50.428 --> 01:02:54.131
The, uh,
the gearbox will overheat.

01:03:11.984 --> 01:03:13.184
Ken, the race
is starting soon.

01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:14.753
Want it on the radio?

01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:16.387
Not unless you do.

01:03:35.306 --> 01:03:36.742
<i>...of the race.</i>

01:03:36.842 --> 01:03:37.675
<i>There they are.</i>

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:39.043
<i>The Maserati going
into the Esses,</i>

01:03:39.143 --> 01:03:40.144
<i>but it's still
the number 2 car,</i>

01:03:40.244 --> 01:03:41.345
<i>driven by Chris Amon.</i>

01:03:41.445 --> 01:03:43.314
<i>In third place
is the number 1 Ford</i>

01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:45.049
<i>that is driven
by Bruce McLaren.</i>

01:03:45.149 --> 01:03:47.485
<i>A tremendously fast start
for the Ford GT.</i>

01:03:47.585 --> 01:03:51.522
<i>3:43.4 lap
for car number 2, a Ford.</i>

01:03:51.622 --> 01:03:53.224
<i>I think
it's a little bit quick</i>

01:03:53.324 --> 01:03:54.458
<i>for this stage of the game.</i>

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:55.727
<i>Little bit quick right now.</i>

01:03:55.827 --> 01:03:57.194
Racing too hot.

01:03:58.462 --> 01:03:59.597
<i>This could go down</i>

01:03:59.697 --> 01:04:01.165
<i>to the last hour or so,
don't you think?</i>

01:04:01.265 --> 01:04:02.266
<i>It could,
but the probabilities</i>

01:04:02.366 --> 01:04:03.434
<i>for a finish like that</i>

01:04:03.534 --> 01:04:05.603
<i>in a 24-hour race
are awfully small.</i>

01:04:05.703 --> 01:04:07.438
<i>Another Ford
has come into the pits.</i>

01:04:07.538 --> 01:04:09.942
<i>It's being pushed into
the pits by the mechanics.</i>

01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:11.509
Head gasket.

01:04:12.176 --> 01:04:14.378
The car's not a moon rocket.

01:04:14.478 --> 01:04:15.680
<i>Trailing
Bob Bondurant in fourth,</i>

01:04:15.781 --> 01:04:16.815
<i>car number 7.</i>

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:19.985
<i>Leading number 20, Ferrari.
Michael Parkes.</i>

01:04:20.084 --> 01:04:22.286
<i>So, we have Ford running one,
two, three. How about that?</i>

01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:24.488
Too soon. Surely too soon.

01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:28.860
<i>One has
to really be respectful</i>

01:04:28.961 --> 01:04:30.261
<i>of the mechanism with any...</i>

01:04:42.406 --> 01:04:43.708
<i>Here's the big story,</i>

01:04:43.809 --> 01:04:46.344
<i>the lead Ford, driven
by Richie Ginther, retired</i>

01:04:46.444 --> 01:04:48.479
<i>with gearbox trouble,
and the new leader...</i>

01:04:48.579 --> 01:04:52.350
Gearbox. I told them.
Be gentle with it.

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:54.052
<i>...and his
partner Lorenzo Bandini...</i>

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.219
<i>...who was one of</i>

01:04:55.319 --> 01:04:57.321
<i>the winning drivers last year.</i>

01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:00.324
Who's there?

01:05:01.592 --> 01:05:02.828
<i>Again, we're back,</i>

01:05:02.928 --> 01:05:05.463
<i>speaking to you live
from Le Mans, France.</i>

01:05:05.563 --> 01:05:08.165
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans,
the Grand Prix of Endurance,</i>

01:05:08.265 --> 01:05:09.868
<i>the 33rd renewal.</i>

01:05:10.936 --> 01:05:12.603
What's that
you're listening to?

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:15.439
Oh, some race over in France.

01:05:18.744 --> 01:05:19.811
Exciting?

01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:22.513
I'm not really paying
much attention.

01:05:22.613 --> 01:05:25.182
<i>However, Phil,
there was one time in 1933,</i>

01:05:25.282 --> 01:05:28.219
<i>when the lead changed hands
three times.</i>

01:05:40.297 --> 01:05:41.666
It's not exactly champagne...

01:05:45.169 --> 01:05:47.139
...but it's got bubbles.

01:06:16.134 --> 01:06:17.535
Thanks, Mollie.

01:06:50.701 --> 01:06:53.471
There's a difference
between Ford and Ferrari...

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:03.414
Grace.

01:07:11.455 --> 01:07:14.793
Yes, sir.
I will send him right in.

01:07:15.794 --> 01:07:16.962
Thank you.

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.800
Mr. Shelby,
Mr. Ford will see you now.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.136
- All right.
- Are you still willing

01:07:24.236 --> 01:07:26.437
to stake your reputation
on this guy?

01:07:28.272 --> 01:07:29.808
This way,
Mr. Shelby.

01:07:39.918 --> 01:07:41.285
Mr. Ford.

01:07:41.787 --> 01:07:42.954
Gentlemen.

01:07:43.054 --> 01:07:44.522
Shelby.

01:07:56.902 --> 01:08:00.005
Give me one reason
why I don't fire everyone

01:08:00.105 --> 01:08:01.940
associated with
this abomination

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.440
starting with you.

01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:11.315
Well, sir...

01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:13.852
I was thinking
about that very question

01:08:13.952 --> 01:08:17.055
as I sat out there
in your lovely waiting room.

01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:20.225
As I was sitting there...

01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:23.561
I watched that little
red folder right there...

01:08:24.328 --> 01:08:26.097
go through four pairs
of hands...

01:08:27.431 --> 01:08:28.834
before it got to you.

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:30.836
'Course that doesn't include...

01:08:31.736 --> 01:08:33.839
the 22 or so
other Ford employees

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:35.439
who probably poked at it
before it made

01:08:35.539 --> 01:08:37.441
its way up to the 19th floor.

01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:40.678
All due respect, sir,

01:08:41.579 --> 01:08:43.647
you can't win a race
by committee.

01:08:45.083 --> 01:08:46.852
You need one man in charge.

01:08:47.551 --> 01:08:49.921
Now, the good news,
as I see it,

01:08:50.288 --> 01:08:52.057
is that even with
all the extra weight...

01:08:54.326 --> 01:08:56.328
we still managed
to put old Mr. Ferrari

01:08:56.427 --> 01:08:57.863
exactly where we want him.

01:08:59.164 --> 01:09:00.464
Did we?

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:02.000
Oh, yes.

01:09:03.869 --> 01:09:05.103
Expand.

01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:07.671
Well...

01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:10.641
sure, we hadn't...

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.677
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:15.713
Or stay cool.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.850
Or stay on the ground.

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:20.952
And a lot of stuff broke.

01:09:21.685 --> 01:09:24.388
In fact, the only thing that
didn't break was the brakes.

01:09:24.956 --> 01:09:26.791
Hell, right now,
we don't even know

01:09:26.892 --> 01:09:29.761
if our paint job will last
the whole 24 hours.

01:09:35.633 --> 01:09:37.068
But our last lap...

01:09:37.601 --> 01:09:41.339
we clocked 218 miles an hour
down the Mulsanne Straight.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.277
Now, in all his years
of racing...

01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:49.713
old Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

01:09:50.949 --> 01:09:52.083
And now he knows...

01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:54.052
without a doubt...

01:09:55.653 --> 01:09:57.688
we're faster than he is...

01:10:00.859 --> 01:10:02.894
even with the wrong driver...

01:10:04.062 --> 01:10:05.562
and all the committees.

01:10:07.299 --> 01:10:08.699
And that's what
he's thinking about

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.202
while he's sitting
in Modena, Italy...

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.738
right now.

01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:16.875
That man is scared to death...

01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:20.912
that this year you actually
might be smart enough

01:10:21.012 --> 01:10:22.479
to start trusting me.

01:10:25.449 --> 01:10:26.851
So, yeah...

01:10:28.619 --> 01:10:31.522
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

01:10:35.226 --> 01:10:36.560
You're welcome.

01:10:54.245 --> 01:10:55.713
Come here.

01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:05.090
See that little building
down there?

01:11:05.723 --> 01:11:07.092
In World War II...

01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:11.730
three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

01:11:13.898 --> 01:11:16.001
You think
Roosevelt beat Hitler?

01:11:17.634 --> 01:11:18.569
Think again.

01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:19.771
This isn't the first time

01:11:19.871 --> 01:11:22.107
Ford Motor's gone
to war in Europe.

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.078
We know how to do more
than push paper.

01:11:29.546 --> 01:11:32.017
And there is one man
running this company.

01:11:34.452 --> 01:11:35.887
You report to him.

01:11:37.288 --> 01:11:38.722
You understand me?

01:11:39.224 --> 01:11:40.624
Yes, sir.

01:11:41.525 --> 01:11:44.062
Go ahead, Carroll.
Go to war.

01:11:47.132 --> 01:11:48.199
Thank you, sir.

01:12:21.132 --> 01:12:22.167
You were right.

01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:24.102
It's the gearbox.

01:12:24.769 --> 01:12:26.104
We ran too hot.

01:12:27.372 --> 01:12:28.740
Three out of four
of 'em broke.

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:31.042
The rod blew on the other one.

01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:37.849
We're going back, Ken.

01:12:41.386 --> 01:12:44.923
They told me I had
"carte blanche" this time.

01:12:46.324 --> 01:12:48.760
I looked it up.
It's French for "horseshit."

01:12:49.227 --> 01:12:51.563
I know they're gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

01:12:51.662 --> 01:12:53.064
soon as they work out how.

01:12:53.597 --> 01:12:55.033
Well, the, uh...

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.268
ice cream's melting.

01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:01.873
All right. Hey, Ken.

01:13:03.408 --> 01:13:05.009
You want me to apologize?

01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:07.779
Mmm.

01:13:08.179 --> 01:13:09.214
You want me to beg?

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.416
I don't know.
Let's try it out.

01:13:11.516 --> 01:13:13.885
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.259
Ken, I'm sorry.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.995
Sincerely.

01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:26.865
Mmm.

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:30.401
Do you have any idea the kind
of shit that I had to eat

01:13:30.502 --> 01:13:32.070
just to get four wheels
on that grid?

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:33.171
No, you don't.

01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:34.939
'Cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

01:13:35.039 --> 01:13:36.908
Now knock it off, Ken.
We got work to do,

01:13:37.008 --> 01:13:38.443
and this car ain't gonna
build itself.

01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:50.721
Okay. All right.

01:13:59.464 --> 01:14:02.000
God.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.768
Come here.

01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:07.005
- Bloody car salesman.
- Shit!

01:14:09.941 --> 01:14:11.708
Come on.
Now you're gonna get it.

01:14:16.347 --> 01:14:17.448
Get off me!

01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:23.421
Stubborn son of a bitch.

01:14:23.521 --> 01:14:24.923
God!

01:14:27.091 --> 01:14:28.726
- You just look...
- Right.

01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:30.862
- Yeah, now.
- You...

01:14:30.962 --> 01:14:32.530
- Ow!
- You all right?

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:34.065
Shit!

01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:37.101
Now you're gonna get it.

01:14:38.702 --> 01:14:40.538
Come here.

01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:44.209
Done.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.481
Mollie, darling.

01:14:51.282 --> 01:14:52.350
Yes, love?

01:14:52.716 --> 01:14:54.285
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

01:14:55.587 --> 01:14:56.854
Yes, love.

01:14:58.489 --> 01:14:59.791
You want one, too, Shelby?

01:15:00.158 --> 01:15:02.260
- No. No.
- Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.229
No. He can get his own.

01:15:04.596 --> 01:15:06.030
Just for me, please.

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.138
How long has that been?

01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:17.141
Oh, it's gotta be three
or four years, at least.

01:15:17.242 --> 01:15:19.210
Right. Riverside.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:22.280
Yeah.
SCCA Divisional Championship.

01:15:22.747 --> 01:15:24.115
You broke my finger.

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:29.854
What's that nippy bloody thing

01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:31.723
you do under the arm,
that thing?

01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:33.524
Yeah. I call that
the Llama Bite.

01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:36.094
You name it?

01:15:36.194 --> 01:15:38.463
Where'd you learn that?
The Girl Scouts?

01:15:38.563 --> 01:15:41.065
- What? You wanna go again?
- Here you go.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.401
You're an angel.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:44.535
Thank you.

01:15:44.636 --> 01:15:45.770
My pleasure.

01:15:46.571 --> 01:15:49.107
Right. Well, I'm about to go
to the grocery store.

01:15:49.207 --> 01:15:51.075
Anything you think
you'll need?

01:15:51.643 --> 01:15:53.811
Um, ice cream.

01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:56.481
Ice cream would be good
and, uh...

01:15:57.348 --> 01:15:58.416
bread.

01:15:59.617 --> 01:16:00.718
Right.

01:16:00.852 --> 01:16:02.453
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

01:16:03.154 --> 01:16:05.223
Thanks, Moll.

01:16:05.323 --> 01:16:06.958
You still take those
for your ticker?

01:16:07.392 --> 01:16:09.560
Only 'cause
they're so delicious.

01:16:09.661 --> 01:16:12.797
- Up yours.
- Oh, go to hell.

01:16:20.438 --> 01:16:22.607
Come on.
Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up.

01:16:38.423 --> 01:16:41.225
Phil! Here's the one
for you, mate.

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:42.593
Dino, come here.

01:17:00.878 --> 01:17:02.046
Well?

01:17:02.146 --> 01:17:03.715
There's still lag
when I hit the gas.

01:17:03.816 --> 01:17:05.183
Let's get rid of
the vacuum secondaries.

01:17:05.283 --> 01:17:06.752
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:08.653
We're gonna rebuild
the throttle assembly.

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.088
Three weeks to Daytona,

01:17:10.188 --> 01:17:13.057
and it still feels
like a bag of squirrels.

01:17:13.157 --> 01:17:14.425
Brake heat.

01:17:14.859 --> 01:17:16.494
That's a whole different
ball game.

01:17:16.594 --> 01:17:19.197
All right, Petey,
let's go for that ride.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.173
What are you doing?

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:32.043
You see that crack?

01:17:32.143 --> 01:17:34.011
That's my marker
for turn eight.

01:17:36.881 --> 01:17:38.349
What, to slow down?

01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:42.387
Uh, brush the brakes
and downshift.

01:17:44.288 --> 01:17:46.924
But you'll be going
150 miles an hour.

01:17:47.658 --> 01:17:48.794
Yeah.

01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:50.428
So how do you see it?

01:17:50.528 --> 01:17:53.564
You're going fast,
but as the car speeds up...

01:17:54.098 --> 01:17:56.467
everything else slows down.

01:17:56.567 --> 01:17:58.236
You don't do that.

01:17:59.036 --> 01:18:00.938
You do this. Right?

01:18:01.038 --> 01:18:03.040
And then you see everything.

01:18:05.676 --> 01:18:07.478
Do you set other markers?

01:18:07.578 --> 01:18:09.914
Indeed I do.

01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:12.583
Lots of them.

01:18:14.452 --> 01:18:16.789
Yeah, 'cause
you can't just push

01:18:16.889 --> 01:18:18.857
the car hard
the whole way, right?

01:18:18.956 --> 01:18:21.492
That's right. You have
to be kind to the car.

01:18:21.592 --> 01:18:25.963
You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you.

01:18:26.732 --> 01:18:30.803
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

01:18:30.903 --> 01:18:32.470
and expect it
to hold together,

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:37.141
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:41.078
Look out there.

01:18:41.979 --> 01:18:45.149
Out there is the perfect lap.

01:18:47.385 --> 01:18:48.553
No mistakes.

01:18:49.187 --> 01:18:51.556
Every gear change,
every corner...

01:18:53.324 --> 01:18:54.392
perfect.

01:18:55.894 --> 01:18:57.261
You see it?

01:19:01.399 --> 01:19:02.567
I think so.

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:06.137
Most people can't.

01:19:07.271 --> 01:19:10.241
Most people don't even know
it's out there, but it is.

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:13.678
It's there.

01:19:16.714 --> 01:19:18.182
You want some ice cream?

01:19:20.718 --> 01:19:22.153
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:24.255
Come on, then.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:26.157
Do you know
what this marker is?

01:19:26.257 --> 01:19:27.291
- What?
- That one.

01:19:27.391 --> 01:19:28.861
Pull my finger.
You'll find out.

01:19:51.048 --> 01:19:53.084
How much longer
before he comes in?

01:19:53.184 --> 01:19:55.553
Uh, well, we change drivers
every four hours,

01:19:55.653 --> 01:19:57.355
- so about 10 minutes.
- <i>No, hang on.</i>

01:19:57.455 --> 01:20:00.057
You're saying Beebe
is 100 percent in charge now?

01:20:00.157 --> 01:20:02.293
<i>Yes,
and he wants Miles gone.</i>

01:20:02.895 --> 01:20:04.595
Look, it's personal
with this guy.

01:20:04.695 --> 01:20:06.664
And, yes, he has the leverage
to stick it to you.

01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:08.666
<i>He and the Deuce
are flying there tomorrow.</i>

01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:09.801
He's gonna tell you in person.

01:20:09.902 --> 01:20:11.068
Now, all he is hoping for

01:20:11.168 --> 01:20:12.771
- is that you lose your cool.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:14.338
<i>It's time to let this go.</i>

01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:15.841
You cannot destroy
the whole thing.

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:16.975
Not for one goddamn guy.

01:20:17.074 --> 01:20:19.011
- Sure, I can.
- <i>Well, why?</i>

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:20.244
'Cause while
we're here talking,

01:20:20.344 --> 01:20:21.679
he's out there
getting it done.

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.222
Oh, shit!

01:20:32.858 --> 01:20:34.458
He's got brake fade.

01:20:41.833 --> 01:20:43.067
Ease off!

01:20:53.177 --> 01:20:54.178
<i>Carroll?</i>

01:20:54.445 --> 01:20:55.680
- Get him out!
- Peter!

01:20:55.781 --> 01:20:57.582
Go on. Go inside.

01:20:57.682 --> 01:20:58.482
Just stay there.

01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:00.052
- Get Ken!
- Ken!

01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.552
Get him out!

01:21:03.254 --> 01:21:04.422
There he is!

01:21:04.522 --> 01:21:05.256
Ken!

01:21:05.356 --> 01:21:06.724
I can see him.

01:21:13.097 --> 01:21:14.498
- Ken!
- Come on.

01:21:21.105 --> 01:21:22.406
The brakes.

01:21:31.716 --> 01:21:34.619
Let's just rip out
the damn engine. All right?

01:21:34.719 --> 01:21:37.421
We can't use it
if we can't stop.

01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:38.857
You know,
the brakes would last longer

01:21:38.957 --> 01:21:40.591
if we slowed down a bit.

01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:43.527
Wouldn't that defeat the whole
purpose of the extra power?

01:21:44.195 --> 01:21:45.296
You know,
I thought the whole point

01:21:45.396 --> 01:21:46.765
was to win the damned race.

01:21:47.498 --> 01:21:49.533
Maybe we could design
a new assembly.

01:21:49.634 --> 01:21:53.337
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits...

01:21:53.739 --> 01:21:56.574
swap out
the entire braking system.

01:21:56.674 --> 01:21:58.209
Rotors included.

01:21:58.777 --> 01:21:59.911
Put in a fresh one.

01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:01.780
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.981
are we allowed to do that?

01:22:03.081 --> 01:22:06.283
I don't know.
I don't read French.

01:22:07.819 --> 01:22:12.758
Well, brakes are "a part"
like any other, right?

01:22:12.858 --> 01:22:15.192
We are allowed
to change parts.

01:22:15.292 --> 01:22:17.161
Yes.
Will we have time to do that?

01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:18.864
I don't know yet,
Charlie.

01:22:19.463 --> 01:22:21.066
I'm gonna take him home.

01:22:21.165 --> 01:22:22.266
All right.

01:22:22.366 --> 01:22:23.601
Sort this shit out.

01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:24.770
I will.

01:22:34.211 --> 01:22:36.614
Have you ever been on fire?

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:42.520
Uh, well, no,
it's never happened to me.

01:22:47.391 --> 01:22:49.861
But the suit's
flameproof, see?

01:22:49.961 --> 01:22:51.529
It, uh, keeps heat out.

01:22:52.496 --> 01:22:53.531
Yeah.

01:22:55.133 --> 01:22:57.501
But Lewis-Evans
burned to death

01:22:57.601 --> 01:22:58.837
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:00.939
He had a flameproof suit on.

01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:05.209
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, um...

01:23:08.013 --> 01:23:09.313
See, he got stuck.

01:23:09.413 --> 01:23:10.882
He couldn't breathe.

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:15.553
So, as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

01:23:19.724 --> 01:23:21.325
Dad got out.

01:23:22.426 --> 01:23:24.261
- He sure did.
- Peter!

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.400
Bye.

01:23:30.234 --> 01:23:31.569
See ya.

01:23:34.172 --> 01:23:35.774
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:23:36.975 --> 01:23:38.309
What's wrong with you?

01:23:39.177 --> 01:23:40.411
And don't be telling me brakes

01:23:40.511 --> 01:23:42.748
or me almost kicking
the bucket out there.

01:23:42.848 --> 01:23:45.382
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

01:23:47.786 --> 01:23:49.154
It's under control.

01:23:49.253 --> 01:23:50.588
What is it?

01:23:50.688 --> 01:23:52.224
You know how we talked about
how you do your thing,

01:23:52.323 --> 01:23:53.390
I do my thing?

01:23:53.491 --> 01:23:54.893
- This is my thing.
- Really, Shel...

01:23:54.993 --> 01:23:56.460
Just trust me, Ken.

01:23:57.129 --> 01:23:58.496
You got a plan?

01:23:59.197 --> 01:24:00.498
Absolutely.

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:02.033
It a good one?

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.268
It's high risk.

01:24:04.368 --> 01:24:05.402
How high risk?

01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:07.005
Extremely high risk.

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.374
Well, that's something.

01:24:11.109 --> 01:24:13.011
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

01:24:25.257 --> 01:24:27.726
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

01:24:28.526 --> 01:24:30.796
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

01:24:30.896 --> 01:24:34.298
but when a man pays $9 million
for an automobile,

01:24:34.398 --> 01:24:36.234
he ought to at least
be able to see it.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:37.903
Well, that sounds
reasonable enough.

01:24:38.003 --> 01:24:39.838
Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?

01:24:39.938 --> 01:24:41.106
Sure.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.008
- In private?
- Uh, yeah.

01:24:43.108 --> 01:24:44.508
That would be preferable.

01:24:44.608 --> 01:24:45.744
All right.
Hey, Phil.

01:24:45.844 --> 01:24:47.478
You wanna take care
of Mr. Ford here?

01:24:47.578 --> 01:24:49.247
Mr. Ford,
that's Phil Remington.

01:24:49.346 --> 01:24:50.414
Of course.

01:24:50.514 --> 01:24:51.582
Come up
to my office, Leo.

01:24:51.682 --> 01:24:52.751
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Phil.

01:24:52.851 --> 01:24:54.953
Give you a little tour
of your car.

01:24:55.787 --> 01:24:58.857
We, uh, took out
your 289 small block...

01:24:59.423 --> 01:25:01.893
and put in a 427 7-liter.

01:25:04.528 --> 01:25:06.832
Uh, firstly,
I want to just clear the air.

01:25:06.932 --> 01:25:09.301
I hope
that whatever disagreements

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.303
between us
can just be chalked up...

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:14.538
to natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

01:25:14.638 --> 01:25:17.575
Oh, I appreciate that, Leo.
Truly, I do.

01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:21.947
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you

01:25:22.047 --> 01:25:23.547
that I have been appointed

01:25:23.647 --> 01:25:26.684
overall executive director
of the racing program.

01:25:27.919 --> 01:25:31.756
Now, I do hope that this
won't be a problem between us.

01:25:32.556 --> 01:25:34.826
Well, I assure you, Leo,
it will not.

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:46.403
Hey, Carroll...

01:25:46.872 --> 01:25:47.638
Carroll!

01:25:47.739 --> 01:25:49.074
And what is that top speed

01:25:49.174 --> 01:25:50.308
with the, uh, 427?

01:25:50.407 --> 01:25:52.177
Well, why don't we take it
for a spin?

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:53.644
- What?
- Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

01:25:53.745 --> 01:25:56.014
- Hop on in. Go on.
- You want me to...

01:25:56.114 --> 01:25:58.316
Just see
what $9 million feels like.

01:25:58.415 --> 01:26:00.852
Hey!

01:26:00.952 --> 01:26:02.153
God...

01:26:05.857 --> 01:26:06.892
Open the door!

01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:08.659
Hey, open the door!

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.962
Open the door!

01:26:13.164 --> 01:26:14.431
Just hold me right there,

01:26:14.531 --> 01:26:16.034
and you take my hand.

01:26:17.668 --> 01:26:20.338
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

01:26:20.437 --> 01:26:22.673
We're gonna build the next one
for comfort. Don't you worry.

01:26:31.383 --> 01:26:32.716
Open the door.

01:26:32.817 --> 01:26:34.252
Sorry, sir,
if you just give me a moment.

01:26:34.352 --> 01:26:35.387
- Open the door.
- It's a sticky one.

01:26:35.519 --> 01:26:37.055
You ready?

01:26:37.155 --> 01:26:38.823
The name on the middle
of that steering wheel

01:26:38.924 --> 01:26:41.359
should tell you that I was
born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:43.527
Attaboy.

01:26:45.663 --> 01:26:48.532
Whoa! It's got a little kick,
doesn't it?

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.735
- Open this door.
- Oh, there we go.

01:26:50.835 --> 01:26:53.104
Good God, Mr. Beebe.
You okay, sir?

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.541
Whoa! Oh, my God!

01:26:58.509 --> 01:27:01.212
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:27:05.016 --> 01:27:06.384
Yeah, baby.

01:27:06.483 --> 01:27:09.154
Yeah, baby.

01:27:12.057 --> 01:27:14.225
It's about right now
the uninitiated

01:27:14.326 --> 01:27:16.527
have a tendency
to soil themselves.

01:27:23.534 --> 01:27:26.271
Oh, my God! Whoa!

01:28:02.907 --> 01:28:04.042
Mr. Ford...

01:28:07.979 --> 01:28:09.314
You okay?

01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:13.918
Mr. Ford...

01:28:14.486 --> 01:28:15.586
you all right?

01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:17.088
I had no idea.

01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:21.092
I had no idea.

01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:25.397
I wish my daddy...

01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:27.465
he were alive to see this.

01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:30.601
To feel this.

01:28:32.103 --> 01:28:34.205
Now, this is not a machine
just anybody can get in

01:28:34.305 --> 01:28:35.440
and easily control.

01:28:35.539 --> 01:28:36.975
Absolutely not.

01:28:37.608 --> 01:28:38.642
I had no idea.

01:28:38.743 --> 01:28:40.178
Now, you wanna win Le Mans.

01:28:40.912 --> 01:28:42.414
If you really wanna take
first place,

01:28:42.514 --> 01:28:44.082
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

01:28:53.258 --> 01:28:54.492
Good timing.

01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:55.626
<i>Now, he knows this car</i>

01:28:55.727 --> 01:28:57.328
because he helped me build it.

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.099
Shelby, you know I've already

01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:02.967
appointed Leo Beebe
director of racing.

01:29:03.068 --> 01:29:05.170
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

01:29:06.071 --> 01:29:08.973
Now, you let Ken Miles
race Daytona.

01:29:09.573 --> 01:29:11.042
If he wins...

01:29:11.843 --> 01:29:13.745
he gets to drive Le Mans.

01:29:16.247 --> 01:29:17.449
And if he doesn't?

01:29:18.216 --> 01:29:20.552
Ford Motor Company
gets full ownership

01:29:20.651 --> 01:29:22.053
of Shelby American.

01:29:22.153 --> 01:29:23.488
Lock, stock, and brand.

01:29:23.587 --> 01:29:24.856
Forever.

01:29:27.926 --> 01:29:30.694
<i>We're in
hour six at the Daytona 24,</i>

01:29:30.795 --> 01:29:33.965
<i>and Fords are dominating
the leaderboard.</i>

01:29:34.065 --> 01:29:37.102
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead</i>

01:29:37.202 --> 01:29:40.271
<i>over the Holman-Moody Ford
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

01:29:41.339 --> 01:29:43.707
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

01:30:01.993 --> 01:30:05.196
Oh, this race is not just
a test of our cars,

01:30:05.296 --> 01:30:06.630
but also our teams.

01:30:06.731 --> 01:30:08.665
As you know, we have
a second team out there today.

01:30:08.766 --> 01:30:10.935
- Holman-Moody.
- That's right.

01:30:11.035 --> 01:30:12.604
<i>Number 95, Hansgen,</i>

01:30:12.703 --> 01:30:13.972
<i>blisters through
the front tri-oval</i>

01:30:14.072 --> 01:30:16.241
<i>while closing in on Ken Miles.</i>

01:30:16.341 --> 01:30:17.641
Walt's pushing her too fast.

01:30:17.742 --> 01:30:19.944
He's pushing 7,000 RPM.

01:30:20.044 --> 01:30:21.546
Hey, get the EZ sign
out there.

01:30:21.645 --> 01:30:23.214
Come on. Move. Do it now.

01:30:23.314 --> 01:30:25.383
Every one of these GTs
out there today

01:30:25.483 --> 01:30:27.085
is under
my direct supervision.

01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:30.188
And of course the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

01:30:30.288 --> 01:30:33.358
The drivers,
the speed, the strategy...

01:30:33.791 --> 01:30:36.628
even the RPMs
are determined by us.

01:30:40.331 --> 01:30:41.966
<i>Ken Miles
is locked in a pitched battle</i>

01:30:42.066 --> 01:30:45.203
<i>with Hansgen
as they pass the grandstand.</i>

01:30:48.206 --> 01:30:51.242
<i>Hansgen is taking a run
at Miles entering turn one.</i>

01:30:51.342 --> 01:30:52.544
<i>Miles is boxed in.</i>

01:30:52.644 --> 01:30:54.946
<i>Hansgen slips by
and takes the lead</i>

01:30:55.046 --> 01:30:57.081
<i>approaching
the infield chicane.</i>

01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:07.859
Cor blimey!

01:31:07.959 --> 01:31:09.527
Did you see that?

01:31:09.627 --> 01:31:10.995
<i>The caution flag is out.</i>

01:31:17.302 --> 01:31:19.904
Still racing.
Hey, we are still racing.

01:31:20.004 --> 01:31:21.172
Come on, guys, let's go!

01:31:21.272 --> 01:31:22.240
Let's go. Move it.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.341
He's coming in.

01:31:24.142 --> 01:31:26.411
Let's go,
let's go, guys. Come on.

01:31:26.511 --> 01:31:27.879
Go, tires up.

01:31:27.979 --> 01:31:29.547
Here, right here.
Let's go. Let's go. Move it.

01:31:29.647 --> 01:31:31.316
- Fuel flying in.
- Breaker bar!

01:31:31.416 --> 01:31:33.218
- We're good.
- It all checked out.

01:31:33.318 --> 01:31:34.852
- 36. 38.
- Go! Go!

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:37.255
Hansgen is right up our arse.

01:31:37.355 --> 01:31:39.057
If I can just get
outta the pit ahead of him...

01:31:39.157 --> 01:31:41.826
She's running hot,
but I think she'll hold.

01:31:41.926 --> 01:31:43.461
- Fuel's low.
- Bring up the scoop.

01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:44.862
She's hot.

01:31:46.965 --> 01:31:48.833
Hey there, Walt.
Good to see you.

01:31:48.933 --> 01:31:50.635
Yeah, after I get out
of this pit, Shelby,

01:31:50.735 --> 01:31:51.836
it's the last time you will.

01:31:51.936 --> 01:31:52.904
Oh, don't worry.

01:31:53.004 --> 01:31:54.339
We got rearview mirrors.

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.508
What happened
to that Mustang he took out?

01:31:58.276 --> 01:31:59.611
Don't know yet.

01:31:59.711 --> 01:32:02.513
I can push her harder
than six, Shel.

01:32:02.614 --> 01:32:05.016
- I can feel it.
- Uh-huh.

01:32:08.386 --> 01:32:12.257
Hey, how come these guys pit
so much faster than we do?

01:32:12.357 --> 01:32:15.960
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.029
- No shit?
- No shit.

01:32:18.496 --> 01:32:20.298
Go! Go, come on.

01:32:21.633 --> 01:32:23.368
We're clear, we're clear.

01:32:23.468 --> 01:32:24.569
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:26.337
Go, go, go!

01:32:26.739 --> 01:32:28.373
Guys, they've already left.

01:32:31.242 --> 01:32:32.110
Hello?

01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:34.345
<i>There's my Mollie. Hello.</i>

01:32:34.879 --> 01:32:35.947
Hiya, love.

01:32:36.047 --> 01:32:37.882
- Mom? Mom?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

01:32:37.982 --> 01:32:38.983
Just having a cuppa.

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:40.753
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

01:32:40.852 --> 01:32:43.254
- Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.m.
- Ask him.

01:32:43.354 --> 01:32:44.689
Go to bed. Now.

01:32:44.789 --> 01:32:46.591
I take it he's not asleep.

01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.459
I'm sure he smuggled
in a radio.

01:32:48.559 --> 01:32:49.827
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:32:49.927 --> 01:32:51.129
He said to ask,
"How are the brakes?"

01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:53.064
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

01:32:53.164 --> 01:32:55.199

they're working for now.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.002
<i>You know, Shelby's been acting
very strange.</i>

- Ken.

01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:00.605
<i>...and put up another team.</i>

01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:01.973
- With a GT.
- <i>Ken.</i>

01:33:02.073 --> 01:33:03.274
Some sort of yampy,

01:33:03.374 --> 01:33:05.310
<i>bloody corporate test
or something.</i>

01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:07.412
Just take a rest
whenever you get a chance.

01:33:07.512 --> 01:33:08.946
<i>Sorry, my love,
what were you saying?</i>

01:33:09.047 --> 01:33:10.548
You've only got a few hours.

01:33:10.648 --> 01:33:11.750
<i>I can't hear you very well.</i>

01:33:11.849 --> 01:33:13.217
<i>I'm sorry. I can't hear you.</i>

01:33:13.318 --> 01:33:14.252
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

01:33:14.352 --> 01:33:16.554
- Good luck.
- <i>I love you, darling.</i>

01:33:16.654 --> 01:33:18.990

01:33:29.667 --> 01:33:31.035
Ain't nothing Miles can do

01:33:31.135 --> 01:33:32.603
this late in the race.

01:33:33.137 --> 01:33:35.673
Engine's hot. We gotta keep it
under six thou.

01:34:23.488 --> 01:34:25.156
All right.

01:34:50.181 --> 01:34:51.949
She could come apart.

01:34:52.049 --> 01:34:53.584
One way to find out.

01:34:56.454 --> 01:34:58.990
I thought we were keeping him
under 6,000?

01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:00.925
Shut up, Don.

01:35:10.168 --> 01:35:11.202

White flag! Last lap!

01:35:40.698 --> 01:35:43.000

01:35:53.511 --> 01:35:55.179

Look at this now.

01:37:03.414 --> 01:37:04.315
Damn it!

01:37:12.323 --> 01:37:13.792
Yeah!

Reliability, strength...

01:37:34.913 --> 01:37:35.814
Yes, Leo.

01:37:35.914 --> 01:37:37.783
<i>Mr. Ford, sir, we won.</i>

01:37:38.951 --> 01:37:39.918
Uh-huh.

01:37:40.018 --> 01:37:42.153
We won! Ford won Daytona.

01:37:42.253 --> 01:37:44.022
Hot damn.

01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:45.791
And which team was it, Leo?

01:37:47.191 --> 01:37:49.761
Shelby American.
Miles driving.

01:37:51.529 --> 01:37:52.831
Son of a bitch.

01:37:53.598 --> 01:37:55.166
All right.

01:37:55.266 --> 01:37:56.701
Where the hell is he?

01:37:56.802 --> 01:37:58.569
Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait.

01:37:58.669 --> 01:38:00.973
Someone lost a bulldog

01:38:02.741 --> 01:38:04.575
No, no. Come on. Come on.

01:38:05.409 --> 01:38:08.512
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:38:08.613 --> 01:38:11.482
Someone get this man a drink.
Someone get him a drink.

01:38:27.164 --> 01:38:28.366
Oi.

01:38:29.266 --> 01:38:31.535
In bed, you.
What are you doing?

01:38:32.104 --> 01:38:33.604
Dirty stop out.

01:38:34.006 --> 01:38:35.040
I was...

01:38:35.841 --> 01:38:38.744
drawing a map, so I could
follow you on Le Mans.

01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:40.478
Mmm.

01:38:42.513 --> 01:38:44.482
Look at that.

01:38:45.851 --> 01:38:47.385
That is spot on.

01:38:47.485 --> 01:38:49.720
You are a dab hand,
very accurate.

01:38:51.722 --> 01:38:53.091
Tell me about the track.

01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:54.893
No, I can't, Petey.

01:38:54.993 --> 01:38:56.227
Please.

01:39:04.702 --> 01:39:06.872
Well, you start
at the start line.

01:39:07.505 --> 01:39:09.407
Yeah, but you
actually start here

01:39:09.507 --> 01:39:11.676
because you have to run
to your car at Le Mans.

01:39:11.777 --> 01:39:12.878
True enough.

01:39:12.978 --> 01:39:16.514
So, once your old man manages
to hobble over...

01:39:17.082 --> 01:39:19.350
- and pull out...
- And not hit anyone.

01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:21.419
Yes, right.

01:39:22.087 --> 01:39:25.891
Then you accelerate very hard
up to Dunlop Bridge...

01:39:26.858 --> 01:39:28.559
road banking away from ya

01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:31.495
and down through the trees
to the Esses...

01:39:31.595 --> 01:39:33.865
and accelerate up
to Tertre Rouge.

01:39:33.965 --> 01:39:36.233
Critical first gear corner.

01:39:36.735 --> 01:39:37.936
Fast entry.

01:39:38.302 --> 01:39:40.972
Keep your speed up
for your exit onto...

01:39:42.074 --> 01:39:43.240
Mulsanne.

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:46.477
Long straightaway,
hemmed in by poplars.

01:39:46.577 --> 01:39:49.881
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

01:39:50.214 --> 01:39:52.283
And down to third, revs up.

01:39:52.383 --> 01:39:53.919
Revs are your friend.

01:39:54.618 --> 01:39:58.190
Get a maximum exit.
Let the car run free.

01:39:58.289 --> 01:40:00.192
Over the brow...

01:40:00.291 --> 01:40:01.592
then wham!

01:40:03.095 --> 01:40:04.328
Mulsanne Corner.

01:40:04.428 --> 01:40:07.099
Accelerate to Arnage

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:08.767
and then over the rise
to the White House.

01:40:08.867 --> 01:40:10.736
You get that right and...

01:40:13.872 --> 01:40:16.373
your first three
and a half minutes...

01:40:17.241 --> 01:40:18.810
of 24 hours.

01:40:19.811 --> 01:40:26.617
But... you can't make
every lap perfect.

01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:29.020
But I can try.

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.360
All right.

01:40:37.162 --> 01:40:38.662
Off to bed, you.

01:40:41.233 --> 01:40:44.035
I will... wake you...

01:40:45.103 --> 01:40:46.570
before I leave for France.

01:40:47.205 --> 01:40:48.439
I promise.

01:40:48.807 --> 01:40:50.976
Okay. Good night.

01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:20.205
Eh, where's, um...

01:41:20.872 --> 01:41:23.842
Where's that?
The Hotel Saint Pierre?

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:26.677
Where?

01:42:12.723 --> 01:42:14.793
It's gonna
rain again tomorrow.

01:42:20.098 --> 01:42:21.766
There's always rain here.

01:42:25.103 --> 01:42:26.537
Start'll be dry though,

01:42:26.637 --> 01:42:30.008
so we'll swap out
your tires come rain.

01:42:32.710 --> 01:42:34.079
Yeah.

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.819
Might be smart
to sleep, Bulldog.

01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:44.455
Well, you, too.

01:42:45.056 --> 01:42:46.191
I'm not driving.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.197
That's a bloody shame, that.

01:42:52.463 --> 01:42:54.498
Oh, hell,
I couldn't make this team.

01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:01.572
I'm gonna go walk
the first corner.

01:43:03.308 --> 01:43:04.943
I figured.

01:43:15.619 --> 01:43:16.955
Counting on it.

01:43:51.823 --> 01:43:53.024
Ken.

01:43:53.124 --> 01:43:54.625
Chaz.

01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:01.232
We'll change
the color of them seats,

01:44:01.333 --> 01:44:02.300
shall we, Frost?

01:44:08.472 --> 01:44:10.875
Well, if this were
a beauty pageant...

01:44:11.276 --> 01:44:12.844
we just lost.

01:44:13.745 --> 01:44:14.779
Looks fast, don't it?

01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:17.614
Ah, looks aren't everything.

01:44:21.585 --> 01:44:24.722
Scarfiotti and Bandini
start for Ferrari.

01:44:30.362 --> 01:44:31.528
You can take him.

01:44:31.628 --> 01:44:33.798
Four minutes, Ken.
Four minutes, buddy.

01:49:12.543 --> 01:49:14.312
<i>Three minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

01:49:14.412 --> 01:49:18.049
- Yeah!
- <i>Ken Miles passed it with a time of 3:34.3.</i>

01:49:30.395 --> 01:49:31.562
Shelby.

01:49:31.663 --> 01:49:35.033
He's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

01:49:35.667 --> 01:49:37.101
Plans change.

01:50:04.195 --> 01:50:07.365
Lap is 3:34.
Track is 8.36.

01:50:07.465 --> 01:50:09.667
Someone tell me
the miles per hour!

01:50:18.943 --> 01:50:20.912
<i>Three minutes, 31.9.</i>

01:50:21.012 --> 01:50:22.146
- Another lap record!
- <i>That's an average speed</i>

01:50:22.246 --> 01:50:25.049
<i>of 142.01 miles per hour.</i>

01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:29.755
Let's go. Let's go, boys.

01:50:29.854 --> 01:50:31.489
Tea's ready, Ken.

01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:32.957
Oh, thank you, Chaz.

01:50:33.458 --> 01:50:36.627
- Happy birthday, old chap!
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

01:50:37.763 --> 01:50:39.163
Go, boys.
Move, move, move.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.401
Need a quick body check!

01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.939
You're three seconds faster
than Gurney.

01:50:48.039 --> 01:50:49.941
If you hadn't blown the start,
you'd be in the lead.

01:50:50.041 --> 01:50:51.476
Can you keep this up?

01:50:51.576 --> 01:50:53.344
Can the car?

01:50:55.313 --> 01:50:57.783
<i>There has been
an incident on turn six.</i>

01:50:57.882 --> 01:51:00.551
<i>Number 18 and number 26
have collided.</i>

01:51:25.610 --> 01:51:27.478
<i>It appears
Ferrari number 20,</i>

01:51:27.578 --> 01:51:30.915
<i>Ludovico Scarfiotti,
has also left the track.</i>

01:51:39.924 --> 01:51:41.760
- All right, watch your head.
- Here you go.

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:42.994
Thank you.

01:51:43.094 --> 01:51:45.096
Have a good dinner, sir.

01:51:45.798 --> 01:51:47.465
Oi, McLaren's pitting.

01:51:51.068 --> 01:51:53.604
Mr. Ford's probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

01:51:53.704 --> 01:51:55.440
What do you mean "probably"?

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:56.809
Rain's coming.

01:51:56.909 --> 01:51:58.476
All right.

01:52:13.892 --> 01:52:15.393
Coming in.

01:52:17.962 --> 01:52:19.630
Go, tires up!

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.568
Get 'em checked out.

01:52:23.668 --> 01:52:25.369
Engine's running hot, Pops.

01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:27.271
- All right.
- She's hot, mate. Crack on.

01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:29.240
- Go.
- Well done, Denny.

01:52:30.675 --> 01:52:32.076
Tire.

01:52:32.744 --> 01:52:34.011
Dash clear.

01:52:34.746 --> 01:52:35.814
Swap.

01:52:38.716 --> 01:52:40.318
We're at 220. We're okay.

01:52:40.685 --> 01:52:41.787
All right.

01:52:41.887 --> 01:52:43.254
Fuel flying in.

01:52:43.354 --> 01:52:44.957
Rear tires
coming up the wall!

01:52:45.089 --> 01:52:46.190
Get the fuel in there.
Come on. Let's go.

01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:47.525
Swap that out.

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:50.762
Front set.

01:52:51.195 --> 01:52:52.630
We're good.

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.202
- Get it moving!
- Go! Go!

01:52:58.636 --> 01:53:00.004
Go, go!

01:53:04.141 --> 01:53:05.309
Good job, guys.
Good job.

01:53:05.409 --> 01:53:07.111
It was
a good change, fellas.

01:53:07.211 --> 01:53:08.513
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

01:53:22.995 --> 01:53:30.201
Did you see that? The great American
automobile magnate leaves in a helicopter. Very classy.

01:53:57.628 --> 01:53:59.530
Easy, Dan.
You're getting boxed in.

01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:01.800
He's not batting
on a full wicket, that one.

01:54:07.605 --> 01:54:09.073
Easy, Dan.

01:54:10.909 --> 01:54:12.276
Oh, bloody hell!

01:54:13.745 --> 01:54:15.513
You arsehole.

01:54:32.163 --> 01:54:33.664
Oh, piss off!

01:54:36.935 --> 01:54:38.636
You wanker!

01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:48.981
A face like a smacked arse,

Go, Ken. Come on, Ken.

01:55:17.341 --> 01:55:19.143
Nice stopwatch.

01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:21.679

Yes, sir.

Okay, sir.
Right away, sir.

Hey!

What the hell are you doing?
Give me that.

01:56:23.175 --> 01:56:24.408
Dumbass.

God!

01:57:41.019 --> 01:57:42.553

Watch yourself, guys.

01:57:58.402 --> 01:58:00.739
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
- Yeah.

01:58:00.839 --> 01:58:03.541
All right. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:58:05.043 --> 01:58:08.046
I had him. I almost had him.

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:11.682
Well, he's putting
another lap on us now.

01:58:11.783 --> 01:58:14.618
All right. Fit it in.
Do the upper arm first.

01:58:14.718 --> 01:58:16.654
Come on, let's go.
Come in now, now. Faster.

01:58:16.755 --> 01:58:17.721

Upper arm first.

01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:21.325
Watch the brake line
pulling it out.

01:58:21.425 --> 01:58:23.427
They're doing it. The brakes.

01:58:24.763 --> 01:58:26.363
I said
watch the brake line.

Faster!
Faster! Faster!

01:58:28.365 --> 01:58:29.433
Coming in.
Watch your back!

01:58:29.533 --> 01:58:30.836
Jeff,
you've gotta be faster!

01:58:44.582 --> 01:58:45.784
Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

01:58:45.884 --> 01:58:46.852
No, no, no.

01:58:47.185 --> 01:58:49.855
It's against the rules.
You cannot just change things.

01:58:49.955 --> 01:58:50.922
Oh, no, no, no.

01:58:51.022 --> 01:58:53.124
You show me where it says
in your book

01:58:53.225 --> 01:58:55.026
that we cannot swap out
the system,

01:58:55.126 --> 01:58:56.127
and then
you can disqualify us.

01:58:56.228 --> 01:58:57.195
Bulldog, back off.

01:58:57.295 --> 01:58:59.231
Calm down. Calm down.

01:58:59.331 --> 01:59:00.664
This is not legal.

01:59:00.765 --> 01:59:02.399
You show me where it says
in that little rule book

01:59:02.499 --> 01:59:04.803
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

01:59:04.903 --> 01:59:06.071
A part is a part.

01:59:06.171 --> 01:59:07.873
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor,
or an upright assembly,

01:59:07.973 --> 01:59:10.008
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

01:59:11.042 --> 01:59:12.710
We read your damn rule book.

01:59:18.515 --> 01:59:20.684

He's pitting.

01:59:27.625 --> 01:59:29.560
Oh, what a shame.

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:30.829
I think he blew a line.

01:59:30.929 --> 01:59:32.396
Well, he was trying
to keep up with you.

01:59:42.539 --> 01:59:44.776
I don't speak Italian,
but he ain't happy.

01:59:56.187 --> 01:59:57.789
Get me out of here, Pops.

01:59:57.889 --> 01:59:59.090
- Come on!
- All right.

01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:00.424
Come on!

02:00:00.524 --> 02:00:02.193
Almost there, Ken.
Almost there.

02:00:02.559 --> 02:00:03.560
How's it looking, buddy?

02:00:03.661 --> 02:00:04.930
One pump, and we're good.

02:00:05.397 --> 02:00:06.530
Car's yours, Ken.

02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:07.799
All right, listen,
you can still take him,

02:00:07.899 --> 02:00:09.134
but you gotta pass him twice.

02:00:09.234 --> 02:00:11.468
I get it. Pass him twice.

02:00:18.276 --> 02:00:19.677

Not bloody good enough,

02:01:25.509 --> 02:01:27.012
He's off his pace.

02:01:28.645 --> 02:01:30.547
He doesn't trust the car yet.

02:01:30.982 --> 02:01:33.885
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

02:01:40.125 --> 02:01:41.525
All right.

02:01:42.526 --> 02:01:44.695
What did you come here for?

02:01:46.530 --> 02:01:47.932
Let's do it.

02:02:12.357 --> 02:02:14.225
That's it! Come on!

02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:26.771
He ain't done it yet.

02:02:30.442 --> 02:02:32.643
He needs to take
another lap on him.

02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:57.802
He needs to pit soon.

02:02:57.902 --> 02:03:00.604
He needs to catch
Bandini first.

02:03:10.515 --> 02:03:12.183
All right, you bastard.

02:03:13.351 --> 02:03:14.819
Let's do this again.

02:03:44.449 --> 02:03:45.850

02:04:26.958 --> 02:04:29.494
He did it. We're in the lead.

02:04:29.594 --> 02:04:30.895
Are we in the lead?

02:04:30.995 --> 02:04:32.931

02:04:33.364 --> 02:04:34.799
Where's Bandini?

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.202
They're done. Finished.

02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:38.937
Ferrari's over.

02:04:39.037 --> 02:04:41.039
McLaren's four minutes

02:04:41.139 --> 02:04:44.776

Want me to wake him?

Nah, let him sleep.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:24.649

- Unbelievable.

02:05:24.749 --> 02:05:25.984
- Hello.

02:05:26.084 --> 02:05:27.085
We're not
quite there yet, but...

02:05:27.185 --> 02:05:28.620
You missed a good meal.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.421
There he is. There he is.

02:05:32.323 --> 02:05:33.558
Brief me, Leo.

02:05:34.225 --> 02:05:36.494
We're running
one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

02:05:37.629 --> 02:05:38.463

02:05:38.563 --> 02:05:40.431
Hulme, Miles.

02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.435
You know, I was thinking,
Mr. Ford...

02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:48.840
wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:51.109
and crossed the finish line
at the exact same time?

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:53.746
They all lined up
and came home together.

02:05:53.845 --> 02:05:55.947
Ford. Ford. Ford.

02:05:56.514 --> 02:05:59.050
I don't think we can
actually do that, sir, but...

02:06:00.285 --> 02:06:01.519
Why not?

02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:04.689
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

02:06:04.789 --> 02:06:07.492
What would you have him do,
slow down?

02:06:08.793 --> 02:06:10.128
Yeah.

02:06:17.001 --> 02:06:19.304
Mr. Ford wants Miles
to slow down.

02:06:19.404 --> 02:06:21.806
He wants all three cars to
cross at the exact same time.

02:06:21.906 --> 02:06:23.808
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford.

02:06:23.908 --> 02:06:25.843
It'll make a great photograph.

02:06:27.145 --> 02:06:29.748
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here,

02:06:29.847 --> 02:06:31.182
and so do you.

02:06:31.282 --> 02:06:33.217
You gonna tell him,
or you need me to?

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:37.322
Don't go near my driver.
Go on.

02:06:38.156 --> 02:06:39.590
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

02:06:39.691 --> 02:06:40.892
Go on now.

02:06:41.326 --> 02:06:43.194
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

02:06:59.844 --> 02:07:02.380
- Guys, let's go. Come on.
- All right, look lively, boys.

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:03.648
Let's go. Frosty.

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.249
Yeah, coming.

02:07:06.117 --> 02:07:07.585
Let's go. Come on.

02:07:07.685 --> 02:07:09.220
What's Beebe want?

02:07:13.558 --> 02:07:14.926
Oh.

02:07:15.026 --> 02:07:17.061
It's off the scale, innit?

02:07:22.233 --> 02:07:24.135
They want you to slow down.

02:07:28.139 --> 02:07:29.674
Run that by me again.

02:07:30.208 --> 02:07:31.909
They want you to slow down.

02:07:34.412 --> 02:07:36.013
You're outshining
their car, Ken.

02:07:36.114 --> 02:07:37.850
You're four minutes up
on McLaren.

02:07:37.949 --> 02:07:39.350
The Deuce wants
the three Fords

02:07:39.450 --> 02:07:42.120
to cross the finish line
one, two, three, all together.

02:07:47.425 --> 02:07:49.660
They're asking that
you be a team player...

02:07:51.195 --> 02:07:52.765
and make that photograph
happen for 'em.

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:56.334
That photograph.
That's good.

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:59.437
That is good. Mmm.

02:08:01.406 --> 02:08:03.374
Ken, even if
you tie for first...

02:08:04.242 --> 02:08:06.177
you'd still be the first man
ever to win...

02:08:06.677 --> 02:08:09.480
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans
in the same year.

02:08:10.081 --> 02:08:11.582
You'd have the triple crown.

02:08:18.956 --> 02:08:20.391
Look, I ain't get...

02:08:21.659 --> 02:08:23.494
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an order

02:08:23.594 --> 02:08:24.996
since day one.

02:08:25.096 --> 02:08:27.165
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

02:08:28.801 --> 02:08:30.368
My choice?

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:33.104
Your choice.

02:08:39.544 --> 02:08:41.546
The engine's
running at boiling.

02:08:41.646 --> 02:08:43.114
The brakes are shot.

02:08:45.983 --> 02:08:47.418
How was that?

02:08:48.986 --> 02:08:50.021
Taken care of.

02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:51.956
The car's yours, Ken.

02:08:52.056 --> 02:08:53.524
Ken, the car's yours.

02:08:54.625 --> 02:08:55.626
Ken!

02:08:55.727 --> 02:08:57.361
Car's yours, Ken.

02:09:30.294 --> 02:09:32.196
<i>It's the Fords
that are the cars to beat,</i>

02:09:32.296 --> 02:09:33.899
<i>claiming the top three
positions...</i>

02:09:33.998 --> 02:09:35.166
What the hell is he doing?

02:09:35.266 --> 02:09:36.667
<i>...led by Ken Miles
in Ford number 1...</i>

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:39.103
<i>If you're not</i>

02:09:39.203 --> 02:09:40.304
<i>watching this right now...</i>

02:09:40.404 --> 02:09:41.606
Don't answer that.

02:09:41.706 --> 02:09:42.975
Get away from it.

02:09:43.074 --> 02:09:44.509
Get away from it.

02:09:44.609 --> 02:09:47.211
<i>Ken Miles in Ford
number 1 is demonstrating</i>

02:09:47.311 --> 02:09:50.314
<i>why he's one of the top drivers
here at Le Mans</i>

02:09:50.414 --> 02:09:52.951
<i>with an outstanding display
of skill.</i>

02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:55.019
<i>Keep an eye on Ford number 1.</i>

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.404
He's gonna break
his own record.

02:10:13.504 --> 02:10:14.740
Shut up.

02:10:23.548 --> 02:10:24.582
Wait for it.

02:10:26.617 --> 02:10:27.786
Wait for it.

02:10:31.322 --> 02:10:32.256
Now.

02:10:35.326 --> 02:10:37.796
Miles. Miles. Miles.

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.164
Miles. Miles. Miles.

02:10:40.264 --> 02:10:42.433
Miles. Miles. Miles.

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:20.839
3:30.6.
That's another record.

02:11:24.943 --> 02:11:27.111
<i>Another lap record
falls to Ken Miles...</i>

02:11:27.211 --> 02:11:28.579
It's a perfect lap.

02:11:28.679 --> 02:11:30.481
<i>...breaking his own record
and virtually guaranteeing</i>

02:11:30.581 --> 02:11:32.951
<i>first place
for Shelby American</i>

02:11:33.051 --> 02:11:34.485
<i>and their exciting GT40.</i>

02:11:34.585 --> 02:11:36.487
<i>Ken Miles
in Shelby America's</i>

02:11:36.587 --> 02:11:40.092
<i>Ford number 1

02:11:40.191 --> 02:11:42.060
<i>Three minutes
and 30.6 seconds...</i>

02:11:42.159 --> 02:11:43.160
Bring him in.

02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:45.030
Right now!
He's outta control.

02:11:45.396 --> 02:11:47.632
Now, you bring him in
before he wrecks that car

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:48.867
and we don't finish.

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.403
Bring him in, Shelby,

02:11:52.503 --> 02:11:55.406
or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:58.910
Ken Miles is behind
the wheel, Leo.

02:11:59.310 --> 02:12:01.212
That's his car to the finish.

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:04.783
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:06.985
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

02:12:07.085 --> 02:12:09.755
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am</i>

02:12:10.521 --> 02:12:11.890
Woo!

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:13.859
Oh.

02:13:36.208 --> 02:13:37.976
Come on, lads, where are ya?

02:13:48.619 --> 02:13:49.821
<i>That is quite a sight to see.</i>

02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:50.989
What's he doing?

02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:52.958
Mum, why is he slowing down?

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:55.326
<i>...the second and third place
Fords to close ranks.</i>

02:14:25.190 --> 02:14:27.926
The three Fords are going
to cross the line together.

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.061
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

02:14:30.162 --> 02:14:32.630
- <i>Here are the Fords lined up in a row...</i>
- Dad. No.

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:33.965
- It's all right.
- Dad.

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:36.333
It's all right.
Look, he's bringing them in.

02:14:36.433 --> 02:14:38.737
- <i>Led by Ken Miles...</i>
- He's bringing them all in together.

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.704
<i>...certainly
the leader of this group</i>

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.841
- <i>and owner of the Le Mans lap record...</i>
- Good for you.

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:45.309
- <i>...set just moments ago.</i>
- Good for you, Ken.

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:05.997
Yeah! Yeah!

02:15:12.469 --> 02:15:14.039
Look at that.

02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:18.009
- Well done, Leo.
- You too, Don.

02:15:35.227 --> 02:15:36.393
<i>Please stand by.</i>

02:15:36.493 --> 02:15:37.996
<i>Final results
are under review.</i>

02:15:38.096 --> 02:15:40.265
...is explain to me
how he's finished first

02:15:40.364 --> 02:15:41.665
and he's not won the race?

02:15:41.766 --> 02:15:43.969
Because McLaren
started from further,

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:45.402
so he came in...
he won.

02:15:45.502 --> 02:15:46.537
Look, it's not a tie.

02:15:46.637 --> 02:15:47.705
No, because McLaren...

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.140
Because McLaren started
further back,

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:51.042
he's saying he's traveled
that little bit further,

02:15:51.142 --> 02:15:52.443
so he's won and not Ken.

02:15:52.543 --> 02:15:54.411
That is bullshit.
That's bullshit.

02:15:54.511 --> 02:15:56.614
Shel! Hold on!

02:16:10.427 --> 02:16:12.130
- Where's the tie?
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:13.331
Where's the goddamn tie?

02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:14.498
What?

02:16:14.598 --> 02:16:15.800
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Shelby!

02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.369
- You knew!
- No, I didn't know!

02:16:17.468 --> 02:16:19.703
- That's enough! Enough!
- Get off me! Hey!

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:21.639
Bruce.

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.742
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

02:16:45.462 --> 02:16:46.932
Shel!

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:52.670
They robbed you, Ken.

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:54.538
<i>Here is the clarification.</i>

02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:57.008
<i>Though the drivers finished
the race in a heat,</i>

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:59.411
<i>McLaren has been ruled
the winner</i>

02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:00.711
<i>as he started
from farther back.</i>

02:17:00.812 --> 02:17:02.380
Some bullshit
technicality.

02:17:02.479 --> 02:17:06.483
<i>Final results. Ford number 2,
driven by McLaren and Amon,</i>

02:17:06.583 --> 02:17:07.919
<i>is the winner.</i>

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.587
<i>Ford number 1, driven
by Miles and Hulme,</i>

02:17:10.688 --> 02:17:11.923
<i>second place.</i>

02:17:12.023 --> 02:17:14.625
<i>In third place,
Bucknum and Hutcherson</i>

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:16.294
<i>in Ford number 5.</i>

02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:17.829
I never should've asked you.

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:25.770
Selling cars, huh?

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.941
That's what they do.

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:34.145
Well, you promised me
the drive.

02:17:37.048 --> 02:17:38.183
Not the win.

02:17:39.384 --> 02:17:40.952
It was a hell of a drive.

02:17:41.853 --> 02:17:43.687
She's a hell of a machine.

02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.824
Oh, she's fast.

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:48.994
Could be faster.

02:17:50.729 --> 02:17:52.263
The 7 liter's sweet...

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.165
but, uh...

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.801
we still need
a lighter chassis.

02:17:56.901 --> 02:18:00.671
I was thinking
bonded aluminium.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:03.842
It's a ground-up rebuild,
but if it works...

02:18:04.409 --> 02:18:06.510
we can lose
a couple hundred pounds.

02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:08.612
Well, what the hell
are we doing here?

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:12.150
Let me take a shower,
get a cup of tea...

02:18:12.683 --> 02:18:14.352
ham and cheese cob
or something.

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:17.155
We're gonna get
the bastards next year.

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:43.680
Got a bit of fuel left
in the tank.

02:18:44.715 --> 02:18:46.583
What do you think
of those honeycomb panels?

02:18:46.683 --> 02:18:48.353
What you were looking for?

02:18:48.685 --> 02:18:50.055
Don't know yet.

02:19:15.612 --> 02:19:17.348
She looks pretty good.

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:31.229
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM...</i>

02:19:32.497 --> 02:19:34.732
<i>where everything fades.</i>

02:19:37.001 --> 02:19:39.636
<i>The machine becomes
weightless.</i>

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:41.840
<i>Just disappears.</i>

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.575
Yeah!

02:19:43.674 --> 02:19:44.708
<i>And all that's left</i>

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:45.844
<i>is a body...</i>

02:19:45.944 --> 02:19:47.946
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:53.650
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:55.987
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:59.690
<i>You feel it coming.</i>

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:02.060
<i>It creeps up on you,
close in your ear.</i>

02:20:10.401 --> 02:20:12.003
<i>Asks you a question.</i>

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.973
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

02:20:20.778 --> 02:20:22.080
Get the van!

02:20:23.414 --> 02:20:24.949
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

02:20:58.516 --> 02:20:59.651
What do you think?

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:02.220
It's fantastic.
Feels really good.

02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:04.222
Nice and smooth.

02:21:05.089 --> 02:21:07.058
No vibration in the box.
Feels really strong.

02:21:07.158 --> 02:21:09.360
You drove it
for less than an hour.

02:21:09.794 --> 02:21:11.729
You can't tell shit
after an hour.

02:21:11.829 --> 02:21:15.300
Go for seven even,
that'd be 14 all in.

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:16.734
Hey, Shel.

02:21:26.377 --> 02:21:29.614
Hey, Shel, that guy,
you know the one in the hat,

02:21:29.713 --> 02:21:32.350
he's ready to close
on those two 427s.

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:34.919
His and hers. Full freight.

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:38.256
They, uh, flew in
from Galveston.

02:21:38.356 --> 02:21:39.723
Uh-huh.

02:21:40.858 --> 02:21:44.996
Uh, I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:47.098
And do what?

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:50.201
Be Carroll Shelby.

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:53.738
Tell them a story,
spin a few magic words.

02:21:54.639 --> 02:21:57.375
What does that mean?
"Magic words"?

02:21:58.576 --> 02:21:59.677
It means...

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:02.113
come outside and say hello

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:04.515
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.817
They're getting the damn cars.

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:07.685
That's what they get
for their money, Phil.

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:08.953
Now, either they want 'em
or they don't.

02:22:09.053 --> 02:22:11.122
- Am I some kind of a lounge act?
- No.

02:22:11.222 --> 02:22:12.857
Am I here to talk people
into things?

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:26.237
It's been six months, Shel.

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:29.507
Six months.

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:36.114
Sometimes they don't
get out of the car.

02:23:11.482 --> 02:23:12.884
Peter!

02:23:13.752 --> 02:23:16.354
Peter, come and take
the garbage out.

02:23:16.454 --> 02:23:17.889
Mr. Shelby.

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:20.825
Oh, hello, Pete.

02:23:22.728 --> 02:23:24.329
I remember that wrench.

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.265
My dad threw it at you.

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:29.934
I believe he did.

02:23:30.736 --> 02:23:32.103
Why?

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.040
Oh.

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:39.210
I think I probably said
something to him.

02:23:39.977 --> 02:23:41.512
Called him a few names.

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:45.149
That's right.

02:23:53.826 --> 02:23:55.393
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:58.296
Well, I did. Uh...

02:23:58.963 --> 02:24:01.165
I came to say hello,
check in on her and...

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:08.005
Then I started thinking
that sometimes...

02:24:10.608 --> 02:24:12.745
uh, words...

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:17.382
just... ar-are not useful.

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:25.590
Tools are useful 'cause
you can make stuff with 'em

02:24:25.690 --> 02:24:27.492
and you can fix stuff
with 'em.

02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:30.461
Here.

02:24:31.362 --> 02:24:32.497
Thanks.

02:24:41.139 --> 02:24:42.940
Your daddy was, uh...

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:48.212
He was your friend.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.386
Yes, he was.

02:24:56.755 --> 02:24:58.423
Yes, sir.

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:05.696
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

02:25:10.869 --> 02:25:12.503
Peter!

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:19.377
I think I've gotta go
help my mum.

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:24.148
What are you doing here then?
Go on.

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:26.451
Bye.

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:14.220
