WEBVTT

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:43.376
"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:54.960
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river...called life."

00:03:57.418 --> 00:04:07.001
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:19.501
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock...to keep flowing!.."

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:38.376
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:45.626
"It is called
the river of life."

00:07:36.043 --> 00:07:37.501
Lord Shiva!

00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:43.001
For all the sins
I have committed,

00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:45.585
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

00:07:45.793 --> 00:07:49.501
But this boy should live...

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:54.668
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:57.876
he should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati...

00:07:58.126 --> 00:08:01.626
Mahendra Baahubali should live!

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:35.710
Dear me!

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.251
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:47.626
Hey! Be careful!

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:15.251
What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:16.668
With all the jewelry on her,

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:18.168
she must have been
a queen or something.

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:20.460
She died with her
hand pointing up!

00:09:24.043 --> 00:09:25.126
Master!

00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:29.376
What happened?

00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:31.168
They must have come
here to kill her.

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:33.751
Looks like she got
the better of them.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:37.626
Master!

00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:43.376
Oh my God! A cave!

00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:45.751
We never knew this existed!

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:50.335
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:53.626
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.543
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

00:09:55.543 --> 00:09:57.001
You are out of your mind?

00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:59.626
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:01.001
What dangers do
you think await him...

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.001
if you send him back there!
- But, Sanga..

00:10:04.543 --> 00:10:06.001
This is my baby.

00:10:06.668 --> 00:10:08.001
I have no children...

00:10:08.168 --> 00:10:09.876
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:15.001
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:18.376
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

00:10:29.418 --> 00:10:30.501
Shiva!

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.376
Shiva!

00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:38.501
What are you doing here,
my dear?

00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.335
What is up there, mother?

00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:50.793
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:52.918
They prey on
and eat little kids!

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.751
But I want to go up there,
mother!

00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:57.210
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:19.251
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:21.001
Why do you keep doing it?

00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:23.710
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.751
Looks like he will
make it this time.

00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:20.168
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:21.626
It goes way up into the clouds...

00:12:21.793 --> 00:12:22.876
...And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:23.751
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:25.501
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:28.251
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:05.501
Shiva!

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:08.210
Your mother is upto something there!

00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:16.335
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:18.626
That is fifteen!

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:22.751
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

00:13:23.418 --> 00:13:27.001
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:29.251
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:32.126
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

00:13:32.543 --> 00:13:35.126
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

00:13:35.876 --> 00:13:38.626
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

00:13:39.043 --> 00:13:40.876
Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

00:13:41.793 --> 00:13:44.626
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:47.501
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

00:13:47.668 --> 00:13:50.001
Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:52.501
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:55.376
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.376
Sanga?
- What?

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:00.043
Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

00:14:00.043 --> 00:14:01.001
Let go of me!

00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:03.626
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:06.501
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:10.126
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:13.626
Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:16.376
Mother.
- What is it now?

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:18.751
How about I carry you...

00:14:18.918 --> 00:14:20.918
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

00:14:20.918 --> 00:14:23.251
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:25.751
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

00:14:25.918 --> 00:14:27.876
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:33.626
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

00:14:33.626 --> 00:14:37.001
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.626
Lord Shiva!

00:14:47.293 --> 00:14:48.668
Sanga!

00:14:48.668 --> 00:14:50.876
See what your lad is up to now!

00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:52.751
What is it this time?

00:14:58.793 --> 00:15:00.876
Shiva, stop!

00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:06.751
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

00:15:12.168 --> 00:15:13.376
Shiva.

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:32.001
Shiva, wait..

00:15:34.043 --> 00:15:38.876
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

00:15:39.043 --> 00:15:44.126
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

00:15:48.793 --> 00:15:53.751
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:56.001
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:59.335
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

00:16:04.126 --> 00:16:08.585
"Who is he and
where he comes from?

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:13.751
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:18.251
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

00:16:18.793 --> 00:16:22.043
"River Bhagirathi, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

00:16:22.043 --> 00:16:27.001
"Look at this great irony."

00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:59.876
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

00:16:59.876 --> 00:17:06.335
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

00:17:07.168 --> 00:17:12.043
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:14.376
"Makes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

00:17:14.543 --> 00:17:18.085
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:21.918
"With the lustrous gem"

00:17:21.918 --> 00:17:24.293
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.626
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:30.001
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

00:17:34.043 --> 00:17:36.543
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

00:17:36.543 --> 00:17:39.043
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:41.418
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:44.835
"who is the leader of demons."

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:05.876
Mother!

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.376
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

00:18:08.793 --> 00:18:11.876
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:15.251
Yes..

00:19:13.918 --> 00:19:16.751
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:21.501
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

00:19:21.668 --> 00:19:24.501
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:28.376
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:32.501
that fell on the Shivalingam
from above.

00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:33.960
Now what is with that?

00:19:35.418 --> 00:19:38.876
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

00:19:39.043 --> 00:19:40.501
Only He would know.

00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:41.668
A small doubt.

00:19:41.668 --> 00:19:43.751
Since my son was
the one who made sure

00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:45.335
the idol is bathed
all the time.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:48.001
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

00:19:48.168 --> 00:19:49.501
or will Sanga's
wish of him always

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:50.793
staying down here come true?

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:54.501
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

00:19:54.918 --> 00:19:57.751
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:03.043
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

00:20:03.043 --> 00:20:04.876
Hail Lord Shiva!

00:20:06.043 --> 00:20:06.751
What did he say?

00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:15.001
Shiva!

00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:17.293
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

00:20:17.293 --> 00:20:19.626
There is somebody up there.

00:20:19.626 --> 00:20:22.251
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

00:20:22.418 --> 00:20:24.751
Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

00:20:25.001 --> 00:20:26.251
Let us go, boys.

00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:33.085
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

00:21:43.543 --> 00:21:48.251
"My heart is lost."

00:21:49.626 --> 00:21:55.376
"Like a drop in the waves."

00:21:55.793 --> 00:22:01.251
"I am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

00:22:02.001 --> 00:22:05.001
"I am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls"

00:22:05.168 --> 00:22:09.876
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

00:22:11.376 --> 00:22:16.335
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:22.501
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:28.751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

00:22:30.043 --> 00:22:35.751
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.751
"I breathe for you..."

00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:11.876
"and only you"

00:23:13.293 --> 00:23:18.751
"Come and let us live together."

00:23:19.376 --> 00:23:24.335
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

00:23:26.168 --> 00:23:31.751
"I chose you as my soul mate."

00:23:32.293 --> 00:23:38.626
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:43.001
"I am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

00:23:43.168 --> 00:23:51.126
"I will break free of every
mountain in no time."

00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:55.835
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

00:23:57.376 --> 00:24:02.085
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:08.251
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

00:24:09.793 --> 00:24:14.876
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

00:24:56.668 --> 00:25:08.585
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

00:25:09.293 --> 00:25:14.626
"Drop a word and I swear"

00:25:16.043 --> 00:25:20.835
"I will give up my life for you."

00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:28.626
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

00:25:29.043 --> 00:25:34.835
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

00:25:35.293 --> 00:25:41.251
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

00:25:41.543 --> 00:25:47.460
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

00:25:47.876 --> 00:25:50.751
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

00:25:50.918 --> 00:25:53.876
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

00:25:54.043 --> 00:25:57.251
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

00:25:57.251 --> 00:26:00.001
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

00:26:00.293 --> 00:26:03.251
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

00:26:03.418 --> 00:26:05.918
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

00:26:05.918 --> 00:26:10.751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

00:26:12.168 --> 00:26:17.335
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

00:26:18.418 --> 00:26:23.751
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:29.960
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

00:26:30.918 --> 00:26:32.251
"The persevering one.."

00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:37.251
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

00:26:38.543 --> 00:26:45.501
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

00:27:47.418 --> 00:27:48.835
Hey!

00:27:51.418 --> 00:27:53.376
Hey! Stop!

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:59.626
Stop!

00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:15.001
Over there!

00:28:35.543 --> 00:28:37.751
Kasi!

00:28:58.293 --> 00:29:00.251
It is a trap. Kill them!

00:29:18.126 --> 00:29:19.501
Dear God!

00:29:39.251 --> 00:29:41.168
How come you got this?

00:29:41.168 --> 00:29:44.418
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

00:29:44.418 --> 00:29:48.126
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:51.585
It was tied to his wrist.
I took it from him.

00:29:51.918 --> 00:29:53.501
I don't know anything else.

00:29:54.168 --> 00:29:55.876
Let me go! Let me..

00:30:04.918 --> 00:30:07.585
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:50.376
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

00:31:04.043 --> 00:31:06.876
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

00:31:07.626 --> 00:31:12.001
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

00:31:12.001 --> 00:31:13.710
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

00:31:23.418 --> 00:31:26.710
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

00:31:33.668 --> 00:31:37.793
Our pride and honour is injured
and we suffer in silence.

00:31:37.793 --> 00:31:41.085
It is not time to shed tears.

00:31:41.418 --> 00:31:43.251
It is time to breathe fire.

00:31:46.043 --> 00:31:48.376
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

00:31:48.918 --> 00:31:51.293
We will remember it
till our last breath.

00:31:51.293 --> 00:31:52.376
To meet our goal

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:54.751
we will clash with thunder..
- We won't lose courage.

00:31:54.918 --> 00:31:57.126
Come hell or high water..
- We will be brave!

00:31:57.293 --> 00:31:59.293
Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

00:31:59.293 --> 00:32:00.876
We shall rescue Devasena!

00:32:05.043 --> 00:32:07.251
If we are to achieve our goal..

00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:23.501
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:26.501
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

00:32:26.793 --> 00:32:28.876
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Kuntala Kingdom..."

00:32:29.168 --> 00:32:31.126
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

00:32:39.543 --> 00:32:40.585
My leader...

00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:43.293
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

00:32:43.293 --> 00:32:45.210
called Kattappa of Mahishmati.

00:32:45.918 --> 00:32:49.335
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:51.626
Karikala Kattappa Nadaar.

00:32:52.543 --> 00:32:54.001
He is indeed a good man.

00:32:54.751 --> 00:32:57.460
He can help us if he wants to.

00:32:59.168 --> 00:33:01.960
But he won't...

00:33:02.876 --> 00:33:06.626
Kattappa is a slave
the throne of Mahishmati.

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:16.876
Kattappa.

00:33:18.168 --> 00:33:21.376
A sword trader, Sheik Aslam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

00:33:33.293 --> 00:33:37.126
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

00:33:37.793 --> 00:33:40.251
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:43.751
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

00:33:46.543 --> 00:33:48.626
With this in hand...

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.626
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

00:33:55.668 --> 00:33:57.501
I call this the Sikander.

00:33:59.126 --> 00:34:00.376
The Pride of Swords.

00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:08.960
A wonderful sword.

00:34:09.251 --> 00:34:13.126
But forgive me, Aslam,
this cannot match our speed.

00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:16.251
How insulting!

00:34:19.876 --> 00:34:24.751
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:30.376
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

00:34:59.376 --> 00:35:01.376
Does that prove
my point, Kattappa?

00:35:24.918 --> 00:35:26.626
I have traveled
across the world

00:35:26.626 --> 00:35:28.460
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:31.126
But never seen
a warrior like you.

00:35:31.626 --> 00:35:34.960
It will be an honour
to break bread with you.

00:35:35.668 --> 00:35:37.960
Please come, Kattappa.
- Please forgive me, Aslam.

00:35:38.418 --> 00:35:42.793
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

00:35:42.793 --> 00:35:43.876
Slave?

00:35:45.251 --> 00:35:49.876
You are the head of the armoury,
how can you be a slave?

00:35:49.876 --> 00:35:52.626
Yes, Aslam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

00:35:52.793 --> 00:35:54.710
He forges the weapons for war.

00:35:55.043 --> 00:35:58.001
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

00:35:58.418 --> 00:36:01.501
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:08.376
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:12.626
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

00:36:14.001 --> 00:36:16.376
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Aslam.

00:36:16.668 --> 00:36:20.626
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

00:36:20.793 --> 00:36:24.335
will serve the throne
of Mahishmati for life.

00:36:25.043 --> 00:36:27.501
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:29.501
you still..

00:36:29.668 --> 00:36:31.626
People who made the pledge
might be dead

00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:35.001
but their word
still lives on, Aslam.

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:39.751
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

00:36:40.251 --> 00:36:45.585
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kattappa.

00:36:47.168 --> 00:36:48.876
If you ever need anything...

00:36:49.168 --> 00:36:51.876
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

00:37:17.043 --> 00:37:18.251
Vaishali.
- Hmm.

00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:22.085
Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

00:39:09.501 --> 00:39:10.876
We have a golden opportunity

00:39:11.043 --> 00:39:12.751
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

00:39:13.043 --> 00:39:16.251
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

00:39:16.251 --> 00:39:18.210
on the next new moon.

00:39:18.668 --> 00:39:21.251
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

00:39:23.626 --> 00:39:25.751
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:29.626
Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

00:39:30.293 --> 00:39:32.126
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:37.710
Avanthika!

00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:51.126
What is this, Avanthika?

00:39:54.501 --> 00:39:55.876
Where did this come from?

00:39:57.043 --> 00:40:00.460
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

00:40:02.251 --> 00:40:06.585
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

00:40:07.293 --> 00:40:09.751
You are not worthy
of this honour. Leave us.

00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:24.126
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

00:40:25.626 --> 00:40:27.960
nor do they come from pain.

00:40:30.043 --> 00:40:34.501
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

00:40:36.293 --> 00:40:39.376
If you can feel their intensity

00:40:41.543 --> 00:40:43.085
then let me go.

00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:54.835
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

00:40:55.293 --> 00:40:57.626
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

00:40:57.793 --> 00:41:00.001
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

00:41:00.168 --> 00:41:03.460
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

00:41:32.251 --> 00:41:40.876
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

00:41:41.543 --> 00:41:50.960
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

00:42:02.793 --> 00:42:09.876
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

00:42:12.168 --> 00:42:16.793
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

00:42:16.793 --> 00:42:21.376
"and the home of peace."

00:42:31.126 --> 00:42:40.501
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

00:42:40.501 --> 00:42:44.418
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

00:42:44.418 --> 00:42:48.751
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

00:43:16.418 --> 00:43:18.043
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

00:43:18.043 --> 00:43:19.876
we caught that bull
in the forests.

00:43:19.876 --> 00:43:23.376
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

00:43:23.376 --> 00:43:24.960
Minister!

00:43:25.668 --> 00:43:31.210
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:33.501
Please come.

00:44:35.626 --> 00:44:36.876
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

00:44:40.668 --> 00:44:41.460
Yes!

00:44:47.626 --> 00:44:48.710
Kill him, father.

00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:02.251
Did you see, grandfather?

00:45:02.626 --> 00:45:04.460
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:06.626
Glory to the king!

00:45:06.626 --> 00:45:08.626
That was a great feat..

00:45:11.168 --> 00:45:12.626
Bravo, Your Majesty!

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:46.751
Bhallaladeva!

00:45:50.543 --> 00:45:51.501
Father!

00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:53.210
He did it!

00:45:53.418 --> 00:45:55.501
Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:07.751
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kattappa.

00:46:10.543 --> 00:46:12.168
I know deep in your heart...

00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:14.460
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

00:46:16.918 --> 00:46:19.960
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

00:46:20.418 --> 00:46:21.710
How do you do it?

00:46:22.793 --> 00:46:24.376
How do you manage to do this?

00:46:25.668 --> 00:46:28.126
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

00:46:30.293 --> 00:46:31.876
Ask for anything!

00:46:34.668 --> 00:46:35.710
Your Majesty!

00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:41.626
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

00:46:43.168 --> 00:46:44.626
Please release her.

00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:53.585
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

00:46:54.126 --> 00:46:58.001
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:06.126
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

00:47:08.293 --> 00:47:09.626
No?

00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:13.210
Then let her suffer.

00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:17.376
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

00:47:52.793 --> 00:47:56.585
Hey old hag! Get up!

00:48:04.293 --> 00:48:05.585
Hey! Get up.

00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:49.251
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

00:48:52.418 --> 00:48:55.751
You chose him over me.

00:48:57.293 --> 00:48:59.460
So where is he now?

00:49:01.376 --> 00:49:04.001
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:06.543
In all these years...

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:11.251
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

00:49:13.876 --> 00:49:17.585
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

00:49:18.168 --> 00:49:21.001
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:23.501
did you ever hear his name?

00:49:28.543 --> 00:49:29.585
No.

00:49:31.376 --> 00:49:34.126
Mahishmati has forgotten him,
Devasena.

00:49:34.543 --> 00:49:37.085
They neither talk
about him anymore...

00:49:37.543 --> 00:49:39.626
and nor do they remember him.

00:49:41.418 --> 00:49:44.376
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:47.001
You and I.

00:49:47.793 --> 00:49:51.251
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

00:49:52.668 --> 00:49:55.126
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:56.751
with my bare hands.

00:49:59.543 --> 00:50:01.876
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

00:51:20.376 --> 00:51:21.626
Lady Devasena!

00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:25.710
At least, accept it now.

00:51:26.251 --> 00:51:27.626
You just have to say yes...

00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:30.126
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

00:51:32.543 --> 00:51:34.751
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:38.626
No, Kattappa.

00:51:39.543 --> 00:51:44.460
My son will come
and he will set me free.

00:51:46.668 --> 00:51:48.960
How can your dead child
come back for you?

00:51:49.626 --> 00:51:51.251
My son is alive.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:55.251
He will come looking for me!

00:51:55.418 --> 00:51:57.501
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

00:51:57.501 --> 00:52:00.210
who is no longer alive,
My Lady!

00:52:01.626 --> 00:52:03.751
Please get a grip on yourself.

00:52:03.751 --> 00:52:07.126
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:11.126
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

00:52:11.126 --> 00:52:12.376
Please agree!

00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:15.251
Please accept it.

00:52:16.543 --> 00:52:20.876
lam begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

00:52:32.418 --> 00:52:37.710
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kattappa?

00:52:39.293 --> 00:52:40.876
This is a funeral pyre!

00:52:46.043 --> 00:52:50.251
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:55.001
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

00:52:58.293 --> 00:52:59.876
My son will come...

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:03.251
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

00:53:03.751 --> 00:53:06.251
My son will make me
light the pyre...

00:53:06.418 --> 00:53:08.626
while Bhalla is still alive.

00:53:09.418 --> 00:53:12.126
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

00:53:12.793 --> 00:53:16.210
beyond the walls
of Mahishmati.

00:53:17.418 --> 00:53:19.376
My son will come!

00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:34.376
What happened, Avanthika?

00:53:34.876 --> 00:53:38.001
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

00:53:39.918 --> 00:53:43.126
He will come back
once he sees me.

00:55:28.793 --> 00:55:31.710
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

00:55:41.293 --> 00:55:43.793
Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

00:55:43.793 --> 00:55:45.085
Avanthi, listen!

00:56:10.876 --> 00:56:13.376
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

00:56:15.418 --> 00:56:17.876
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

00:56:31.043 --> 00:56:32.126
Oh My God!

00:56:32.418 --> 00:56:34.376
Hey! What is with the arrows?

00:56:34.376 --> 00:56:36.085
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

00:56:38.126 --> 00:56:41.126
Who are you?
- That is better.

00:56:41.126 --> 00:56:43.168
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:44.751
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:51.335
What a girl!

00:57:16.418 --> 00:57:20.751
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:25.251
Avanthika?

00:57:34.543 --> 00:57:37.876
Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

00:57:37.876 --> 00:57:39.335
I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

00:57:40.043 --> 00:57:42.376
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

00:57:42.376 --> 00:57:44.126
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

00:57:48.501 --> 00:57:51.710
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

00:57:53.751 --> 00:57:57.543
But before that I have
to ask you one thing. - What?

00:57:57.543 --> 00:58:02.251
Who are you? Who are you?

00:58:09.543 --> 00:58:10.501
You got a sword in your hand.

00:58:10.668 --> 00:58:14.085
Not to mention body armor, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

00:58:14.793 --> 00:58:17.335
lam not asking about
this mask of yours!

00:58:17.668 --> 00:58:21.376
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

00:58:26.126 --> 00:58:27.210
Shall I tell you?

00:58:30.168 --> 00:58:33.210
You are a woman and I am a man.

00:58:35.918 --> 00:58:37.626
I have come here to love you.

00:59:16.793 --> 00:59:18.960
Now that hurts.

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:30.626
This is mine.

01:01:32.168 --> 01:01:33.960
I dropped it near the waterfall.

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:41.710
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:45.085
Just for me?

01:01:47.043 --> 01:01:50.126
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:53.876
I still don't see it.

01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:23.626
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:29.376
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:36.251
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

01:02:36.251 --> 01:02:41.501
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

01:02:41.501 --> 01:02:46.501
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:51.126
"But now I want to live for you."

01:02:51.543 --> 01:02:56.501
"I made a pact with my heart."

01:02:56.668 --> 01:03:01.876
"I will be born a hundred times
for you."

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:06.751
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

01:03:06.918 --> 01:03:12.751
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

01:03:33.668 --> 01:03:38.376
"I will write our love saga
on the skies."

01:03:38.793 --> 01:03:43.376
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

01:03:43.626 --> 01:03:53.626
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:57.751
"Being in love is so lovely."

01:03:57.918 --> 01:04:03.126
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:08.168
"But now I want to live for you."

01:04:08.168 --> 01:04:17.876
"I made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

01:04:18.543 --> 01:04:23.418
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:28.501
"I am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

01:04:28.668 --> 01:04:33.876
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

01:04:33.876 --> 01:04:39.626
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

01:05:01.918 --> 01:05:05.626
This is something
the world has never seen.

01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:08.585
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

01:05:08.918 --> 01:05:11.585
Even the Gods don't
get this honour.

01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:13.835
Once this is erected,

01:05:14.126 --> 01:05:17.001
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

01:05:17.168 --> 01:05:19.335
will live on forever
in the entire world.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:24.918
Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

01:05:24.918 --> 01:05:27.001
There will be celebrations galore.

01:05:27.168 --> 01:05:30.876
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.626
Avanthika..

01:06:34.543 --> 01:06:35.835
Frisk her!

01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:12.751
Attack!

01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:14.835
Baahubali...

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:21.626
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

01:08:22.001 --> 01:08:25.751
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:34.960
Forgive me.

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:14.001
Shiva!

01:11:03.876 --> 01:11:06.335
Please forgive me, Shiva.

01:11:07.418 --> 01:11:09.001
I didn't know what else to do.

01:11:10.168 --> 01:11:13.460
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:15.876
You are mine, Avanthika.

01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:19.001
Everything that is yours
is mine.

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:23.126
I also share your obligation.

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:35.751
I don't know who Devasena is.

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:38.460
If your goal is to free her

01:11:40.793 --> 01:11:42.335
then I will bring her back!

01:11:44.418 --> 01:11:45.751
This is my word.

01:11:51.043 --> 01:11:55.751
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:59.626
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart"

01:12:00.501 --> 01:12:09.876
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

01:12:09.876 --> 01:12:14.460
"O Kingdom! see who
comes your way."

01:13:14.168 --> 01:13:17.876
Mahishmati,
you can breathe now.

01:13:18.918 --> 01:13:20.835
My son is back.

01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:23.501
Baahubali is back!

01:14:44.376 --> 01:14:45.668
When the king's statue
is erected...

01:14:45.668 --> 01:14:47.001
everyone must applaud!

01:14:48.043 --> 01:14:49.168
When the king's statue
is erected

01:14:49.168 --> 01:14:50.585
everyone must applaud!

01:15:36.043 --> 01:15:37.460
No worries!

01:15:37.793 --> 01:15:39.876
It is a hundred foot statue.

01:15:39.876 --> 01:15:42.501
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:46.126
Thank you.

01:16:57.001 --> 01:16:58.460
Baahubali...

01:16:59.793 --> 01:17:03.043
Baahubali?
- Baahubali.

01:17:03.043 --> 01:17:05.626
Baahubali!
- Baahubali!

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:13.126
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:13.126 --> 01:17:15.543
Move it!
- Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:25.001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:25.918 --> 01:17:28.585
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:37.585
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:40.043 --> 01:17:41.251
Hey!

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:43.126
Who was that?

01:17:47.418 --> 01:17:49.876
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:17:50.043 --> 01:17:52.751
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:18:23.376 --> 01:18:25.626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:18:25.793 --> 01:18:37.626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.376
Baahubali!

01:19:04.293 --> 01:19:07.001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:19:07.168 --> 01:19:09.876
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:19:10.043 --> 01:19:13.126
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:19:51.001 --> 01:19:53.710
It is been fifteen days
since my son left! - Hold this.

01:19:53.918 --> 01:19:55.626
He hasn't returned yet.

01:19:55.793 --> 01:19:57.626
I wonder if he is alright.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.501
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

01:19:59.668 --> 01:20:00.501
What can happen to him?

01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:03.001
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

01:20:03.168 --> 01:20:05.626
Maybe he found his family.

01:20:05.793 --> 01:20:07.876
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

01:20:08.043 --> 01:20:10.835
Will he never come? Will he not
call me mother again? - Sanga.

01:20:11.043 --> 01:20:12.876
People, hurry up, will you?

01:20:26.793 --> 01:20:28.001
Come on.

01:20:36.543 --> 01:20:38.126
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

01:20:38.293 --> 01:20:40.210
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

01:20:40.376 --> 01:20:43.501
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

01:20:44.293 --> 01:20:48.460
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

01:20:51.251 --> 01:20:51.751
Alright!

01:20:56.668 --> 01:21:00.751
"Mahasena!"

01:21:05.751 --> 01:21:07.251
Who says that Baahubali,

01:21:07.418 --> 01:21:10.001
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

01:21:16.751 --> 01:21:19.126
lam nothing, but a living dead.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:24.460
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:33.751
Baahubali! Baahubali!

01:21:34.918 --> 01:21:38.585
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

01:21:39.376 --> 01:21:44.751
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

01:21:45.626 --> 01:21:48.251
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:54.751
Or did they see someone?

01:21:55.918 --> 01:21:57.585
No! Impossible!

01:21:59.168 --> 01:22:01.585
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:02.960
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:04.210
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.210
What are you doing here?

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:48.210
I.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

01:23:01.043 --> 01:23:04.626
Who first uttered the
name of Baahubali in the crowd?

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:12.210
Am I talking to these walls?

01:23:12.418 --> 01:23:15.626
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

01:23:16.293 --> 01:23:20.251
I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

01:23:22.376 --> 01:23:24.835
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:26.460
I saw him, My Lord!

01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:17.585
I have seen those eyes before!

01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:22.876
Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:38.876
Hey, who are you?

01:24:55.543 --> 01:24:57.126
He is here! Catch him.

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:09.376
Catch him..

01:25:33.876 --> 01:25:34.960
That way..

01:26:32.293 --> 01:26:33.460
Sound the alarm!

01:26:50.543 --> 01:26:52.126
I have come to rescue you.

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:56.751
Kattappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:58.585
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:00.251
You head north.

01:27:18.626 --> 01:27:21.751
Kattappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

01:27:22.001 --> 01:27:24.626
As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:28.710
Come on!

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:38.001
The alarm!

01:28:47.293 --> 01:28:48.501
Attack!

01:29:50.293 --> 01:29:52.710
Get up!

01:29:55.043 --> 01:29:57.001
You lousy old hag!

01:29:59.418 --> 01:30:01.210
All these years of punishment...

01:30:01.376 --> 01:30:03.126
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

01:30:05.626 --> 01:30:09.626
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

01:31:17.001 --> 01:31:19.460
Kattappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going to kill me!

01:31:19.626 --> 01:31:21.001
My Prince!

01:31:21.168 --> 01:31:23.460
It is my duty to protect you!

01:31:25.918 --> 01:31:28.460
To get to you,

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.335
he has to go through me first!

01:32:39.668 --> 01:32:40.876
Kattappa!

01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:43.460
Kattappa!

01:32:54.376 --> 01:32:55.501
Devasena!

01:32:58.668 --> 01:32:59.835
Attack!

01:33:00.001 --> 01:33:02.501
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

01:33:02.668 --> 01:33:04.335
Hail Mahishmati!

01:33:36.376 --> 01:33:37.626
Shiva!

01:33:43.043 --> 01:33:44.376
Siddha!

01:33:56.793 --> 01:34:00.001
"Mahasena!"

01:34:03.626 --> 01:34:06.626
"Mahasena!"

01:34:11.543 --> 01:34:14.376
"Mahasena!"

01:35:13.293 --> 01:35:14.710
Anila!

01:35:58.501 --> 01:36:02.501
Baahubali!

01:37:27.376 --> 01:37:30.001
You resurrected our lost hope.

01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:31.710
You made a great
warrior out of him

01:37:31.876 --> 01:37:33.001
and brought him back to us.

01:37:33.168 --> 01:37:38.376
Kingdom of Mahishmati will be
eternally grateful to you.

01:37:56.043 --> 01:37:57.876
My mother looks at me

01:37:58.751 --> 01:38:00.876
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:06.126
I don't know
who they are...

01:38:06.293 --> 01:38:08.001
and yet they look at me like
lam their God!

01:38:10.626 --> 01:38:12.751
And when I see the wounds
that fester on that lady...

01:38:13.293 --> 01:38:15.126
I have never met before,

01:38:16.793 --> 01:38:21.126
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:23.751
Who am I?

01:38:25.168 --> 01:38:29.876
You are the son of our savior (God)
Amarendra Baahubali.

01:38:31.293 --> 01:38:34.085
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

01:38:34.293 --> 01:38:36.001
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

01:38:37.876 --> 01:38:39.501
You are the fruit of our

01:38:39.668 --> 01:38:43.376
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:47.376
<i>The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.</i>

01:38:47.626 --> 01:38:49.876
<i>This kingdom of Mahishmati
was established</i>

01:38:50.043 --> 01:38:53.001
<i>by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.</i>

01:38:53.168 --> 01:38:56.085
<i>Though elder,
Bijjaladeva was not crowned</i>

01:38:56.251 --> 01:38:58.251
<i>because of his conniving nature.</i>

01:38:58.418 --> 01:39:03.626
<i>But Bijjaladeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities</i>

01:39:04.126 --> 01:39:07.210
<i>and it caused
great turmoil in him.</i>

01:39:08.626 --> 01:39:12.210
<i>The King died.</i>

01:39:12.793 --> 01:39:15.876
<i>He was survived by his subjects</i>

01:39:16.043 --> 01:39:19.210
<i>and the queen
who was six months pregnant.</i>

01:39:19.376 --> 01:39:23.126
<i>Three months passed by and
Mahishmati continued to mourn.</i>

01:39:23.376 --> 01:39:26.835
<i>The King's sister-in-law
and Bijjaladeva's wife, Sivagami</i>

01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:30.626
<i>took up the reins of the kingdom.</i>

01:39:31.751 --> 01:39:33.210
<i>Being an astute woman</i>

01:39:33.376 --> 01:39:35.251
<i>she focused on
the welfare of the people</i>

01:39:35.418 --> 01:39:37.501
and defense
of the kingdom.

01:39:38.668 --> 01:39:41.501
<i>She could hear
the howls of the jackals</i>

01:39:41.668 --> 01:39:44.126
<i>making their move
towards the throne.</i>

01:39:45.251 --> 01:39:50.751
<i>It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labour.</i>

01:39:57.876 --> 01:40:00.001
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

01:40:05.043 --> 01:40:06.251
It is a boy!

01:40:31.668 --> 01:40:32.876
Baahubali!

01:40:38.668 --> 01:40:43.126
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

01:40:43.293 --> 01:40:46.501
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

01:40:46.668 --> 01:40:48.501
Hail him!

01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:52.751
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

01:40:52.918 --> 01:40:55.376
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

01:40:55.543 --> 01:40:58.335
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

01:40:58.501 --> 01:41:00.251
Being a leader
is the first tenet

01:41:00.418 --> 01:41:02.126
of being a Kshatriya,
Minister.

01:41:12.418 --> 01:41:13.835
Lady Sivagami?

01:41:34.043 --> 01:41:38.085
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

01:41:38.793 --> 01:41:41.126
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

01:41:52.293 --> 01:41:53.626
Kattappa!

01:41:57.751 --> 01:42:00.835
They have soiled Mahishmati
with their revolt.

01:42:01.543 --> 01:42:03.460
Wash it off with their blood!

01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:13.876
How can you stand and watch...

01:42:14.043 --> 01:42:15.585
while our people
are being hacked to death?

01:42:18.418 --> 01:42:22.460
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

01:42:23.793 --> 01:42:25.710
Kill Kattappa!

01:42:44.126 --> 01:42:48.335
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

01:42:51.626 --> 01:42:55.710
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

01:43:11.376 --> 01:43:14.210
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

01:43:14.376 --> 01:43:15.876
and we had the privilege to witness it.

01:43:16.043 --> 01:43:19.626
Please ascend the throne
and rule Mahishmati!

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:23.001
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

01:43:23.168 --> 01:43:26.626
Then whose is it? O!Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

01:43:26.793 --> 01:43:31.376
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

01:43:31.543 --> 01:43:33.001
Tell him, Sivagami!

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:57.376
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

01:43:58.001 --> 01:44:03.751
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

01:44:03.918 --> 01:44:05.876
will be crowned
the king of Mahishmati.

01:44:07.793 --> 01:44:11.001
This is my word
and my word is the law!

01:44:15.793 --> 01:44:26.210
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

01:44:27.626 --> 01:44:38.001
"May you live long,
my dear Baahubali."

01:44:48.418 --> 01:44:53.751
"Ambrosia and venom."

01:44:55.543 --> 01:45:02.876
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

01:45:15.168 --> 01:45:19.126
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

01:45:19.293 --> 01:45:23.876
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Baahubali."

01:45:27.043 --> 01:45:31.001
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:34.710
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

01:45:42.043 --> 01:45:44.210
Kattappa! I am very hungry.

01:45:44.418 --> 01:45:45.835
Can I have some?

01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:47.251
My Prince!

01:45:48.043 --> 01:45:50.126
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

01:45:52.751 --> 01:45:54.085
Now give me some.

01:45:55.126 --> 01:45:57.835
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

01:45:58.001 --> 01:45:59.960
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

01:46:00.918 --> 01:46:03.460
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

01:46:04.293 --> 01:46:05.626
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:07.085
for you in your
royal chambers.

01:46:07.293 --> 01:46:09.876
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

01:46:10.043 --> 01:46:12.085
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

01:46:12.251 --> 01:46:14.501
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.710
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

01:46:17.876 --> 01:46:21.376
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

01:46:24.043 --> 01:46:25.251
Feed me, uncle.

01:47:00.876 --> 01:47:03.126
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

01:47:03.293 --> 01:47:05.501
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

01:47:05.668 --> 01:47:07.835
"His enemies remain astonished."

01:47:08.001 --> 01:47:14.876
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

01:47:46.376 --> 01:47:47.626
Bhallaladeva!

01:47:59.126 --> 01:48:00.585
Great Bhalla!

01:48:01.668 --> 01:48:04.626
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

01:48:28.418 --> 01:48:30.501
Both the princes
have excelled

01:48:30.668 --> 01:48:32.126
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

01:48:32.293 --> 01:48:34.085
They stand as equals.

01:48:34.376 --> 01:48:39.710
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

01:48:41.793 --> 01:48:44.835
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

01:48:45.001 --> 01:48:47.001
Now he is testing me

01:48:47.168 --> 01:48:50.876
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

01:48:51.043 --> 01:48:54.751
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

01:49:06.793 --> 01:49:09.710
<i>Before she could decide
on who will ascend the throne</i>

01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:12.876
<i>the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.</i>

01:49:13.043 --> 01:49:16.251
<i>In the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.</i>

01:49:19.043 --> 01:49:23.001
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

01:49:25.418 --> 01:49:27.751
Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

01:49:28.418 --> 01:49:31.001
<i>The young Princes searched</i>

01:49:31.168 --> 01:49:34.001
<i>for the traitor
in neighbouring kingdoms.</i>

01:49:34.168 --> 01:49:36.626
<i>Finally they found out
that he was hiding</i>

01:49:36.876 --> 01:49:38.751
<i>in a den of thieves
called Singapuram.</i>

01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:40.335
<i>It is a lawless place
where bandits</i>

01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:41.751
<i>thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.</i>

01:49:41.918 --> 01:49:44.251
<i>Strangers who drew
attention to themselves</i>

01:49:44.418 --> 01:49:47.501
<i>were in mortal danger.</i>

01:49:57.168 --> 01:49:59.960
I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:02.376
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

01:50:02.543 --> 01:50:03.876
Are you a SPY?

01:50:10.418 --> 01:50:12.626
If our guards were this good..

01:50:12.793 --> 01:50:14.001
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

01:50:14.168 --> 01:50:15.626
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

01:50:18.293 --> 01:50:19.960
Swords or smarts?

01:50:20.126 --> 01:50:21.585
Whichever is sharper.

01:50:29.626 --> 01:50:30.960
Do you have a drink?

01:50:38.418 --> 01:50:39.501
Big one?

01:50:49.043 --> 01:50:50.376
Much bigger?

01:50:58.001 --> 01:50:59.251
Do you have money?

01:51:08.293 --> 01:51:11.376
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

01:51:31.043 --> 01:51:33.001
Look what is happening there..

01:51:33.168 --> 01:51:34.335
Come on!

01:51:39.168 --> 01:51:42.210
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

01:52:06.293 --> 01:52:11.335
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:52:12.293 --> 01:52:17.335
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:52:18.293 --> 01:52:24.085
"Let your lips find mine."

01:52:24.293 --> 01:52:30.001
"Come and steal
myself from me."

01:52:30.251 --> 01:52:34.710
"You are the charming one."

01:52:36.168 --> 01:52:41.001
"You are the charming one."

01:52:42.293 --> 01:52:45.126
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

01:52:45.293 --> 01:52:48.126
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

01:52:48.293 --> 01:52:53.710
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

01:52:54.293 --> 01:52:56.876
"Let me drink
this love potion."

01:52:57.043 --> 01:53:00.126
"You are mine, just mine."

01:53:00.293 --> 01:53:05.251
"lntoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:53:06.293 --> 01:53:12.001
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:53:48.293 --> 01:53:53.960
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

01:54:00.251 --> 01:54:05.876
"You got the magic,
no one has."

01:54:12.293 --> 01:54:18.126
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

01:54:18.293 --> 01:54:24.251
"I want to be your
and make you mine, too."

01:54:24.668 --> 01:54:28.376
"Come and enjoy me."

01:54:30.168 --> 01:54:34.501
"You are the charming one."

01:54:34.668 --> 01:54:35.960
"Yes, I am."

01:54:36.126 --> 01:54:41.126
"You are the charming one."

01:54:42.293 --> 01:54:45.126
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

01:54:45.293 --> 01:54:47.626
"Please listen to me, my love."

01:54:48.376 --> 01:54:51.126
"Let me drink
this love potion."

01:54:51.126 --> 01:54:54.293
"You are mine, just mine."

01:54:54.293 --> 01:54:59.751
"lntoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:05.751
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

01:56:13.668 --> 01:56:16.751
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

01:56:16.918 --> 01:56:18.001
Bhalla!

01:56:51.251 --> 01:56:53.085
Kattappa..

01:57:23.251 --> 01:57:26.876
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

01:57:27.376 --> 01:57:28.876
Kalakeya!

01:57:32.751 --> 01:57:35.085
The Kalakeyas don't believe
in tactical attack.

01:57:35.668 --> 01:57:38.210
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

01:57:39.418 --> 01:57:41.626
If they barge into the kingdom

01:57:42.626 --> 01:57:45.001
they will kill every
innocent child

01:57:46.293 --> 01:57:49.376
and violate every woman.

01:57:50.543 --> 01:57:53.251
They will destroy
and burn everything.

01:57:54.376 --> 01:57:57.210
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

01:57:57.543 --> 01:57:59.376
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

01:57:59.543 --> 01:58:00.876
Why should we be scared?

01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:05.585
How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

01:58:42.293 --> 01:58:44.460
When wild bulls barge into the crops

01:58:44.626 --> 01:58:49.460
and lands that the Kalakeyas
plunder, are both left barren.

01:58:58.418 --> 01:59:00.876
We have to defend our kingdom

01:59:01.626 --> 01:59:03.751
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

01:59:04.293 --> 01:59:06.501
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

01:59:07.418 --> 01:59:08.751
"The trident strategy".

01:59:12.418 --> 01:59:17.085
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

01:59:17.293 --> 01:59:19.626
You want to go to war
with something untested?

01:59:19.793 --> 01:59:21.460
If no one has used it

01:59:21.626 --> 01:59:23.835
the Kalakeyas wouldn't
expect it either.

01:59:24.001 --> 01:59:26.210
That is why
we should implement it.

01:59:26.376 --> 01:59:29.626
I second the plan.
- I approve it.

01:59:30.751 --> 01:59:34.501
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

01:59:34.668 --> 01:59:40.001
Kattappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

01:59:40.543 --> 01:59:42.210
Five thousand, Your Highness!

01:59:42.918 --> 01:59:47.085
I will use armor and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

01:59:47.251 --> 01:59:49.835
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

01:59:51.793 --> 01:59:54.585
I will command the forces
to the north.

01:59:57.293 --> 01:59:59.876
I will take responsibility
for the south.

02:00:02.168 --> 02:00:03.585
According to our sources,

02:00:03.751 --> 02:00:06.126
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

02:00:06.293 --> 02:00:08.585
and send half
his army forward.

02:00:09.418 --> 02:00:12.335
Our military formation
and our weapons...

02:00:12.751 --> 02:00:15.960
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

02:00:16.418 --> 02:00:20.960
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

02:00:21.126 --> 02:00:24.460
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

02:00:24.626 --> 02:00:27.126
In the middle of that battle

02:00:27.293 --> 02:00:29.501
both princes with
their cavalry

02:00:29.668 --> 02:00:32.501
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

02:00:32.668 --> 02:00:35.710
It will take them
at least three hours

02:00:36.251 --> 02:00:38.460
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

02:00:38.626 --> 02:00:41.126
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

02:00:41.293 --> 02:00:45.001
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

02:00:45.168 --> 02:00:48.251
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

02:00:48.418 --> 02:00:50.501
of who should be the king.

02:00:52.793 --> 02:00:55.626
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

02:00:55.793 --> 02:00:58.001
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

02:00:59.793 --> 02:01:02.501
My Lord has
the perfect solution. - Yes.

02:01:05.751 --> 02:01:09.335
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

02:01:11.418 --> 02:01:13.251
Bhalla, Baahu.

02:01:13.793 --> 02:01:16.835
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

02:01:17.376 --> 02:01:18.626
Accept it.

02:01:20.043 --> 02:01:22.876
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

02:01:27.043 --> 02:01:30.001
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

02:01:30.168 --> 02:01:34.335
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

02:01:34.793 --> 02:01:37.751
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

02:01:38.793 --> 02:01:40.876
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

02:01:41.043 --> 02:01:43.001
all went to Bhallaladeva!

02:01:45.126 --> 02:01:47.251
You should have objected, Baahu!

02:01:50.793 --> 02:01:53.460
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

02:01:53.918 --> 02:01:57.085
You brilliantly hoodwinked
Baahubali! - What hoodwink?

02:01:57.543 --> 02:02:01.751
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

02:02:02.626 --> 02:02:05.001
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

02:02:06.543 --> 02:02:08.876
I made the strong one
even stronger.

02:02:09.626 --> 02:02:12.876
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:16.251
Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

02:02:16.418 --> 02:02:17.835
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

02:02:18.043 --> 02:02:19.585
the tents and
bring them to him.

02:02:52.293 --> 02:02:56.751
(Sanskrit chants)

02:02:57.126 --> 02:03:02.376
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:18.251 --> 02:03:23.626
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:23.793 --> 02:03:27.876
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:28.043 --> 02:03:31.251
Welcome, Bhallaladeva!

02:03:31.418 --> 02:03:34.126
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:45.668 --> 02:03:51.001
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:51.168 --> 02:03:56.376
(Sanskrit chants)

02:03:59.376 --> 02:04:02.376
Invincible!
- Invincible!

02:04:02.543 --> 02:04:05.251
Invincible!
- Invincible!

02:04:05.918 --> 02:04:08.126
Welcome, Baahubali!

02:04:13.168 --> 02:04:18.626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:04:18.793 --> 02:04:22.960
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:04:23.168 --> 02:04:25.251
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:04:39.918 --> 02:04:42.960
Bahu, it is
a time-honoured ritual.

02:04:43.126 --> 02:04:43.960
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

02:04:44.168 --> 02:04:46.251
the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

02:04:46.418 --> 02:04:48.501
If you don't offer the sacrifice

02:04:48.668 --> 02:04:50.001
the Goddess will be angry.

02:04:50.168 --> 02:04:51.835
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

02:04:52.043 --> 02:04:53.710
the blood of
this innocent animal

02:04:54.126 --> 02:04:56.501
when my own blood
can be offered?

02:04:59.293 --> 02:05:01.835
Hail Mahishmati!
- Hail Mahishmati!

02:05:02.001 --> 02:05:05.501
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:05:05.668 --> 02:05:07.960
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:05:08.168 --> 02:05:10.251
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:05:10.418 --> 02:05:13.876
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:05:21.793 --> 02:05:23.960
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

02:05:26.626 --> 02:05:28.126
This is your last chance.

02:05:28.293 --> 02:05:31.585
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

02:05:46.668 --> 02:05:48.626
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

02:05:48.793 --> 02:05:51.335
the one who kills me
would be made king.

02:05:56.793 --> 02:05:59.501
And if both of them
die at my hands?

02:06:16.876 --> 02:06:19.501
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

02:06:19.668 --> 02:06:20.960
and then I will have
a son with you.

02:06:21.126 --> 02:06:22.710
You can make him the king!

02:06:31.626 --> 02:06:33.251
I want him alive.

02:06:34.293 --> 02:06:37.585
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

02:06:37.751 --> 02:06:40.376
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

02:06:47.293 --> 02:06:52.126
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

02:06:52.793 --> 02:06:54.751
He should be alive.

02:06:56.251 --> 02:06:58.085
Kattappa!
<i>'</i> My Lady!

02:06:58.251 --> 02:07:00.335
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:32.751
It is ready.

02:07:32.918 --> 02:07:33.835
Arm the weapon.

02:07:39.626 --> 02:07:40.876
Fire!

02:07:46.793 --> 02:07:48.335
Baahubali's command!

02:08:15.918 --> 02:08:17.001
Get ready!

02:08:18.376 --> 02:08:20.210
Arm the weapons.

02:09:27.168 --> 02:09:28.335
Attack!

02:10:27.251 --> 02:10:29.376
Attack!

02:12:10.043 --> 02:12:12.835
Well done, Baahubali!
- Well done.

02:12:42.293 --> 02:12:44.251
Soldiers. Attack.

02:12:44.418 --> 02:12:45.960
Attack!

02:13:05.168 --> 02:13:07.751
Hold! Hold strong!

02:13:23.918 --> 02:13:25.751
Swords group, step forward!

02:15:29.918 --> 02:15:32.126
Trident strategy begins!

02:18:01.293 --> 02:18:02.585
Stop.

02:18:08.793 --> 02:18:10.001
Bhallaladeva!

02:18:15.751 --> 02:18:17.001
My Prince?

02:18:28.418 --> 02:18:30.335
My Prince!
- Army!

02:20:02.251 --> 02:20:05.251
Hold your lines!

02:20:13.043 --> 02:20:15.876
Hold your lines! Hold them!

02:20:59.918 --> 02:21:01.876
Our defenses are in tatters.

02:21:02.293 --> 02:21:04.460
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Mahishmati soil...

02:21:04.626 --> 02:21:05.626
for the first time!

02:21:05.793 --> 02:21:08.210
This is the death of us. Death!

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:11.460
Death! Death!

02:22:01.876 --> 02:22:03.126
Death!

02:22:06.418 --> 02:22:07.835
Death!

02:22:11.293 --> 02:22:12.626
Soldiers!

02:22:20.501 --> 02:22:22.085
What is death?

02:22:23.751 --> 02:22:26.085
To think that the
enemy is stronger

02:22:26.251 --> 02:22:27.876
than our resolve, is death!

02:22:29.751 --> 02:22:34.126
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

02:22:36.043 --> 02:22:40.501
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

02:22:42.418 --> 02:22:45.501
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

02:22:45.668 --> 02:22:48.001
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

02:22:53.043 --> 02:22:56.126
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

02:22:57.251 --> 02:23:01.335
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

02:23:01.543 --> 02:23:05.751
lam about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

02:23:11.168 --> 02:23:13.251
Who is with me?

02:23:15.293 --> 02:23:16.626
Me!

02:23:16.793 --> 02:23:19.626
Who will die with me?
- Me!

02:23:19.876 --> 02:23:24.626
Who will vanquish that
death and live on? - Me!

02:23:26.376 --> 02:23:27.626
Me!

02:23:27.793 --> 02:23:30.251
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:23:30.418 --> 02:23:32.376
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:23:32.626 --> 02:23:36.751
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:23:47.376 --> 02:23:49.001
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:23:50.543 --> 02:23:54.085
Hail Mahishmathi!

02:24:20.543 --> 02:24:21.751
Sethupathy!

02:29:13.793 --> 02:29:16.085
<i>I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes</i>

02:29:16.251 --> 02:29:18.751
<i>and feast on his guts.</i>

02:29:19.543 --> 02:29:24.251
<i>His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!</i>

02:29:48.668 --> 02:29:50.001
MY son!

02:29:51.626 --> 02:29:54.626
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

02:30:17.751 --> 02:30:19.126
MY son!

02:30:19.876 --> 02:30:26.251
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

02:30:31.501 --> 02:30:35.501
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

02:30:35.668 --> 02:30:39.001
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

02:30:40.501 --> 02:30:42.876
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Mahishmati

02:30:43.043 --> 02:30:45.126
for generations to come!

02:30:45.751 --> 02:30:51.376
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

02:30:51.918 --> 02:30:54.251
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

02:30:54.418 --> 02:30:57.751
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

02:31:01.168 --> 02:31:05.126
I proclaim Baahubali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

02:31:13.793 --> 02:31:17.126
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

02:31:17.293 --> 02:31:22.251
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

02:31:22.418 --> 02:31:24.710
You saw it with your own eyes!

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:29.085
He has to be the King! Only he!

02:31:29.543 --> 02:31:31.876
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

02:31:32.043 --> 02:31:33.835
by the number
of enemies he has killed

02:31:34.001 --> 02:31:36.501
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

02:31:37.043 --> 02:31:38.001
During the battle

02:31:38.168 --> 02:31:41.126
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

02:31:41.376 --> 02:31:44.376
Baahubali,
while killing the enemy

02:31:44.543 --> 02:31:47.001
also managed
to save his subjects.

02:31:48.001 --> 02:31:50.876
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

02:31:53.168 --> 02:31:56.626
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

02:31:57.293 --> 02:32:01.626
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

02:32:05.376 --> 02:32:07.001
So, saving a couple
of common men

02:32:07.168 --> 02:32:08.585
is now the
qualification to rule?

02:32:08.751 --> 02:32:11.126
Baahubali will be
crowned the King of

02:32:11.293 --> 02:32:13.376
Mahishmati on
an auspicious day.

02:32:14.418 --> 02:32:17.876
That is my word
and my word is law!

02:32:22.168 --> 02:32:24.585
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:25.168 --> 02:32:27.626
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:27.793 --> 02:32:30.001
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:30.251 --> 02:32:32.210
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:32.376 --> 02:32:36.626
Baahubali!
-Baahubali!

02:32:36.793 --> 02:32:39.960
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:40.126 --> 02:32:42.210
Baahubali! Baahubali!

02:32:52.751 --> 02:32:55.001
Amarendra Baahubali!

02:32:56.168 --> 02:32:59.751
Glory to him!

02:33:03.418 --> 02:33:06.626
Amarendra Baahubali!

02:33:07.251 --> 02:33:11.001
Glory to him!

02:33:11.251 --> 02:33:14.376
Glory to him!

02:33:16.626 --> 02:33:19.626
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

02:33:20.751 --> 02:33:23.460
We are so glad
to hear about him.

02:33:24.418 --> 02:33:27.626
I wish we can
see the great man once!

02:33:30.168 --> 02:33:31.585
He is no more.

02:33:33.293 --> 02:33:35.126
The saviour is no more!
(That God is no more!)

02:33:42.418 --> 02:33:44.626
You said no enemy
could come near him.

02:33:45.126 --> 02:33:47.376
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

02:33:48.918 --> 02:33:51.001
How did such
a great warrior die?

02:33:52.918 --> 02:33:56.460
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

02:33:57.376 --> 02:33:59.126
is a stab in the back, Mahendra.

02:33:59.543 --> 02:34:02.251
Who? Who was it?

02:34:05.501 --> 02:34:06.876
That traitor...

02:34:09.126 --> 02:34:10.335
was me!

02:34:27.543 --> 02:34:38.501
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

02:34:41.376 --> 02:34:51.501
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

02:34:52.918 --> 02:35:02.835
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

02:35:04.626 --> 02:35:15.876
"It cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

02:35:17.168 --> 02:35:33.376
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

02:35:35.126 --> 02:35:41.626
"It is called
the river of life."
