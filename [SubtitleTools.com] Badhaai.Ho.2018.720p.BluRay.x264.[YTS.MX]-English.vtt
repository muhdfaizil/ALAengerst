WEBVTT

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:46.707
"Glory to the great Lord Hanuman!"

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:54.124
"Grace our home with
your presence, 0 Lord Hanuman"

00:03:54.124 --> 00:04:01.249
"Grace our home with
your presence, 0 Lord Hanuman"

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:09.499
"Come bless our home,
along with Lord Rama..."

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:13.916
- Baljit!
- Wait!

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:16.541
- Baljltl
- m be back in a bit!

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:29.791
"Grace our home with
your presence, 0 Lord Hanuman"

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.457
The prayers are
over and you've turned up now?

00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:35.707
Give me a break. My maid skipped work
again! Who's going to do our dishes, you?

00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:39.166
Gular!

00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:46.249
Gular!

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:50.374
Gular!

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:00.582
Nakul!

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:03.291
Nakul, for your mother's sake!

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.999
The sherbet's here!

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:15.707
Here are the rules.

00:05:15.707 --> 00:05:17.374
Show me!
Read and understand.

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:18.541
You especially!

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:22.332
Babli, see the rules.

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:23.749
Come on, let's start!

00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:27.166
In such a hurry to gamble...

00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.666
They've skipped six whole verses!

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:37.374
- Girls, are you ready?
- Yes, Yes... Call out the numbers!

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.749
- Sixteen.
- Wow.

00:05:44.207 --> 00:05:45.916
- Forty-six.
- Do it properly, Nakul!

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:48.166
The jar's so small,
my hand barely fits!

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.541
Then tilt it!

00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:51.166
All the chips will fall out.

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:54.166
Thief at your door, Number Four.

00:05:58.374 --> 00:05:59.499
No luck today!

00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:02.457
MS Dhoni, Number Seven.

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:04.916
Bring your mom some luck!

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:06.374
Pack of cards, Fifty-Two.

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:09.249
Your place or mine... Sixty-Nine.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:10.041
Mine!

00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:12.624
Sixty-Nine.

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:13.582
Got anything?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:15.791
Want to check it out?

00:06:18.124 --> 00:06:19.541
Inderpuri Bus number Forty-Seven.

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.041
I finished a line!

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.541
Come, see for yourself!

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.999
It's really not my day!

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:26.082
Tell me about it...

00:06:26.082 --> 00:06:27.291
- Check it.
- All good?

00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:29.249
Come on, where's my prize!

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.249
Here you go.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.332
Oh no, What's this, Babli? Liquid
soap? Give me a bar instead.

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:38.457
You know how these maids are,
she'll squeeze it out in four days.

00:06:38.457 --> 00:06:40.249
Come on, don't make a fuss.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.707
Last time when you gave me Sprite,
did I ask for Fanta?

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:44.874
I know!

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:51.499
Hello. Yeah, I'm a little busy.
Some important work...

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:53.791
Can't I have work on a Sunday?

00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:56.499
Yeah, I'll be there.
Sure. See you. Bye.

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:15.499
Buying flowers?

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:17.166
Yeah.

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:18.374
Oh.

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:22.874
When I ask you to buy me flowers,
you get all awkward.

00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:25.041
And today you're gifting flowers?

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:26.582
What else can I buy?

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.624
You'll only buy flowers for me,
understand?

00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:33.832
Gift her this.

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:35.416
Are you crazy?

00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:36.874
Don't worry, she'll appreciate this.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:37.916
Are you sure?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.832
Chill, she just wants to meet you.
It's not like we're getting engaged!

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:43.541
Sure? I mean,
we can get a cheaper bottle...

00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.332
Surely she'll appreciate that, too?

00:07:50.207 --> 00:07:52.249
Thank you,
Aunty... I don't drink. actually.

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:55.166
He's lying, Mom.
He can drink anyone under the table.

00:07:55.832 --> 00:07:57.332
You don't have to feel shy...

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.166
Reneé had her first drink with me!

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:06.332
Aunty, actually I need to pick Dad up,
so I've to drive back home, that's why.

00:08:06.332 --> 00:08:08.707
Ah. Where do you stay?

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.124
Lodhi colony.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.666
Father's a government employee?

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:13.874
Yeah, railways.

00:08:15.124 --> 00:08:16.541
Indian Railway Services, yeah.

00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:18.791
No. He's a Ticket Inspector
with the Northern Railways.

00:08:23.416 --> 00:08:27.291
- Renee was telling me, you're going
to the US for onsite work? - Yeah...

00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:31.249
Well, laughing at your boss's sad
jokes ought to get you somewhere!

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.291
Reneé!

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:35.707
I haven't decided yet, Aunty.
Haven't discussed it with my parents.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.124
But I'm sure they'll
be more than happy, no?

00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:39.291
Yeah, maybe.

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:41.374
But mom feels a family
should stay together.

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:44.707
I also think I can't
stay away from home for long.

00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:48.166
This wine is really nice.

00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:49.916
Thank you.

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:51.791
Really nice, yes.

00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:56.957
- Come again.
- Sure.

00:08:57.457 --> 00:08:58.624
- Bye, aunty.
- See you.

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:00.916
Oh, 'Kaushiks'!

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.957
You know I've always wondered...

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:06.166
Whether 'Kaushiks' should
have an apostrophe or not...

00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:07.332
Mom!

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:09.624
No, it's just really interesting...

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.582
To know what the
car owner wants to say.

00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:14.666
That this car belongs
to the Kaushik family...

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:17.291
Or that there are many
Kaushiks sitting in it?

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.249
Well Aunty, the car is ours.

00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.749
And I've got the papers to prove it.

00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:25.166
But only my brother can
say What this is supposed to mean.

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:26.582
He got this done.

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:29.457
As far as this horror-movie
font is concerned...

00:09:29.832 --> 00:09:32.999
I think it
our family's a little... Spooky

00:09:34.457 --> 00:09:35.749
We must beware, then.

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:38.332
- Goodbye, Aunty.
- Goodbye.

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:38.999
See you.

00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:49.416
What?

00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:01.666
Where is he?

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:03.457
- Ravinder!
- Yes, sir.

00:10:03.457 --> 00:10:05.999
Here's a piece of advice.
Listen carefully.

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:07.916
Hey... It'll fall!

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:12.666
Look. You're already married.

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:16.749
But before you have a baby...
Think it through. Plan it properly.

00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:19.124
Today's generation... they're not like us.

00:10:19.124 --> 00:10:21.582
They neither value their parents,
nor their time.

00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:23.374
There he comes!

00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:24.749
Thank God!

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:32.957
I've been waiting
since half an hour!

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.332
Why're you lying, Dad?
The train arrived 5 minutes ago!

00:10:35.332 --> 00:10:38.499
Stand in this heat and
you'll know how it feels.

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:46.832
What are you doing?

00:10:47.457 --> 00:10:48.541
It's his job.

00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:52.291
Fine, give him mangoes.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:53.916
Wait.

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:05.291
Here.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.666
Go, enjoy.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:16.166
Do they grow in our backyard?

00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:17.916
Drive slow.

00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:19.916
It doesn't speed
up even on top gear!

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:22.416
"Drive slow!"

00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:25.999
Told you so many times,
let me get a new car...

00:11:26.291 --> 00:11:27.499
What's wrong with this one?

00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:30.249
It's been over thirteen years.
I've had no problems with it.

00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:31.999
Just listen to yourself.

00:11:46.082 --> 00:11:48.499
Reached, finally!

00:11:51.707 --> 00:11:52.666
Mr Kaushik!

00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:54.207
Hello... All well?

00:11:54.749 --> 00:11:56.666
- Carry the carton carefully.
- Yes.

00:11:58.332 --> 00:11:59.916
- Hello, Uncle.
- Got mangoes, son?

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:00.707
Yes, Uncle.

00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:02.832
Not that Dad's going to share any...

00:12:10.457 --> 00:12:11.249
Mom...

00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:13.374
How're the mangoes?

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.416
Really sweet, son. Delicious!

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:20.249
Not a patch on 'Langra' mangoes.
Those are a class apart.

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:22.416
They've called me early to office...

00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:30.124
They go to office together every day...

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.666
And he's still always
on the phone with her.

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.249
I don't get it!

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:36.624
He's grown up.
Let him do as he pleases.

00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:39.499
Focus on the younger one. His
final year exams are approaching!

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:40.916
God knows what he'll do.

00:12:41.249 --> 00:12:43.082
What will he do?
Embarrass us, what else.

00:12:43.082 --> 00:12:45.207
We'll have to hand him
everything on a platter.

00:12:45.457 --> 00:12:46.999
I'll have to use up
my retirement fund!

00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:51.832
Nakul never gave us any trouble.
Especially when it came to studies.

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:54.582
Gular...

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:56.166
Gular!

00:12:58.499 --> 00:12:59.957
Dad got us mangoes, son.
Have some.

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.249
Not interested, mom.
You help yourself.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:05.832
Look at his attitude.
Won't even talk properly!

00:13:06.332 --> 00:13:08.832
Why blame him? It's your fault.

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:16.416
Before he was born, didn't
you leave Khatauli and go to Meerut...

00:13:16.624 --> 00:13:18.082
...to your parents'?

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.291
He was bound to be detached!

00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:24.416
The water in that city is cursed.

00:13:25.582 --> 00:13:28.249
Even Shravan Kumar - the
devoted son from the Ramayana -

00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:29.749
betrayed his parents there.

00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:34.832
What are you staring at?

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.957
It's in the scriptures!

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:38.999
Tell you what.

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:42.666
The demon Raavan's wife Mandotari,
didn't she also hail from Meerut?

00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:45.374
Of course, I'm the witch
haunting this blessed home!

00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:47.707
After all,
your son is Lord Rama incarnate!

00:13:47.707 --> 00:13:49.916
- Oh, Babli, what's all this?
- You keep quiet!

00:13:50.332 --> 00:13:53.041
So tell me,
what's wrong with my son?

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.332
Tell me?

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:59.374
In fact, may God bless
everyone with a son like him...

00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:01.291
Mom, can't you give it a break?

00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:05.291
When she speaks against you,
you barely squeak...

00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:08.166
And you boss over
your poor old mother!

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.291
That's your only weakness, Jeetu!

00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.249
You're scared of your wife!

00:14:13.457 --> 00:14:14.416
Why, mom...

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:15.416
"Why, mom!“

00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:30.041
Polished off 3 slices...

00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:32.457
"Not a patch on 'Langra'!", she says!

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:38.832
Goddamn, imagine my plight. Spending
all afternoon playing Bingo host!

00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:41.374
- Aunty was there too!
- Which aunty?

00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:42.666
Your mom!

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.582
"Which aunty?"

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:47.499
After they were done playing Bingo...

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:49.249
As I was smoking a cigarette
on the terrace...

00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:51.791
Chawla Aunty's daughter-in-law
tried getting cozy with me!

00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.291
I politely told her,
"Spare me, sister! I'm a simple guy.

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:56.957
I don't want to jump into bed with you!“

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:58.999
- Nonsense! You're lying.
- I swear, I'm not!

00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:01.416
- You didn't do anything?
- No man.

00:15:01.874 --> 00:15:05.124
How, dude?
I think she's smoking hot!

00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:06.624
No bro, not in the colony...

00:15:07.124 --> 00:15:10.707
Just say the truth-
you chickened out.

00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:13.999
Junney... I'm no chicken...

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:16.499
And we all know who's
the real wuss here!

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:19.999
Dimple's been posting tons
of pictures with her hubby recently.

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:22.707
- Saw them?
- Show me!

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.332
She looks so happy finally.

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:29.166
Right, Junney?

00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:31.624
Have a look!

00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:32.874
Bloody rascal!

00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:37.457
Bro, you always worried
that you couldn't “make her happy“...

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:39.749
And now that she's happy,
you're jealous!

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:44.249
Bastards,
I never should've told you.

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:49.374
I trusted you like brothers.

00:15:49.624 --> 00:15:52.041
Got drunk and confided in you.
Fine, go on!

00:15:52.207 --> 00:15:54.291
Man, you're getting all serious, Junney.

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.291
We're childhood friends,
can't we pull your leg?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.832
Now that you've told us it's a
sore spot... we won't touch it. Okay?

00:16:00.832 --> 00:16:05.416
Next lime,
we'll stand and stomp on it!

00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:13.332
Tell us,
what does he have that you don't?

00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:21.499
Damn!

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:24.041
- Are you okay?
- Man, he got upset.

00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:27.499
Balls! Can't take a joke
but makes fun of others.

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:29.249
You're no different!

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.749
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

00:16:37.374 --> 00:16:38.374
What is it?

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:39.791
Mango pulp.

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:42.832
Babli...

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:46.291
If you've cooled off now,
can I show you something?

00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:59.291
I barely have the
time to read all this now...

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:01.207
My poem's been published!

00:17:01.707 --> 00:17:03.582
- Really?
- Yes. Page number 34.

00:17:09.457 --> 00:17:11.541
Season of Communion', by...

00:17:12.457 --> 00:17:14.041
The Brooding Poet.

00:17:14.916 --> 00:17:17.707
I've told you so many times
don't use that pen name!

00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:19.416
It sounds like you're
always distraught.

00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:21.832
Why would I be distraught
with you by my side!

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.249
It's just poetic license, silly.

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.082
Thank God you weren't married
to Harivansh Rai Bachchan...

00:17:28.082 --> 00:17:30.249
Or you would've told him...

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:33.124
"Bachcha" means child,
it sounds so childish!"

00:17:35.374 --> 00:17:37.624
The skies are roaring tonight, eh?

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:39.541
- Should I read It out?
- Yes.

00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:42.291
Season of Communion'.

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:45.707
"Today, upon the fertile land...“

00:17:48.207 --> 00:17:49.957
"Today, upon the fertile land“

00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:51.707
"The sky rains down“

00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.624
"- The sky...
- Rains down!"

00:17:54.791 --> 00:17:56.832
"Parched land and dark clouds“

00:17:56.832 --> 00:17:58.999
"An enchanting encounter"

00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:01.832
"A flaming bolt strikes..."

00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.416
A flaming bolt, meaning?

00:18:05.207 --> 00:18:06.207
Lightening.

00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:09.791
"A flaming bolt strikes"

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:11.999
"Born is a tender song of love“

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:14.666
"Seeds sprout life from dead rocks"

00:18:15.374 --> 00:18:19.291
"As estrangement departs..."

00:18:20.707 --> 00:18:22.999
- It's lovely.
- You know something?

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:26.041
You look beautiful
with your hair open.

00:18:26.249 --> 00:18:27.624
Hush, stop it!

00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:33.874
19 WEEKS LATER

00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.874
Listen... How does it look?

00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:44.124
It can be tightened from the back.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.499
What's the occasion?
I can help you decide accordingly.

00:18:46.707 --> 00:18:48.749
My cousin's getting married
in Meerut. Didn't I tell you?

00:18:49.874 --> 00:18:50.874
One second.

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.166
Why don't you get
something like this?

00:18:56.457 --> 00:18:57.249
This?

00:18:58.707 --> 00:19:00.374
Are you judging my family's taste?

00:19:00.624 --> 00:19:02.999
It's so much fun.
You get irritated so easily!

00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:06.791
Yes Dad!

00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:07.791
Where are you?

00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:09.791
I'm shopping for Shanoo's wedding.

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:11.999
Mom's unwell and
you're busy shopping!

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.124
What happened to her?

00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:14.832
Take her to Dr Bagga's, quick!

00:19:14.832 --> 00:19:15.874
Okay, I'll be there right away.

00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.499
- Let's go, quick!
- Where?

00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:19.374
Mom's not well... I have to go.

00:19:19.582 --> 00:19:20.957
- Wait a second.
- Yeah.

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:23.541
- At least change your clothes.
- Oh, shit.

00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.791
- Don't won-y, I'll get it billed.
- Okay.

00:19:38.249 --> 00:19:39.207
Looks fine.

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:41.874
127/82...

00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:44.791
You're taking your
medicines on time, right?

00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:45.499
Yes.

00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.124
You're perfectly fit!

00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:50.791
Bagga Uncle, actually, it's not BP...

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:52.416
Let me talk to your mother!

00:19:54.332 --> 00:19:55.541
Yes, tell me.

00:19:55.874 --> 00:19:58.582
Doctor, I haven't been
feeling well since a day or two.

00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:02.749
I'm constantly exhausted;
I've lost my appetite...

00:20:03.457 --> 00:20:06.041
My stomach's been cramping...
And I've vomited a few times too.

00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:08.249
Oh, so that's the matter...

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:11.749
You must have eaten
some rubbish from the streets.

00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:14.707
I see you've put on weight too!

00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:18.874
People these days have no self-control.

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:22.874
Mr Mathur came to me right before you.

00:20:23.124 --> 00:20:24.666
He's got piles.

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:26.249
Piles.

00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:28.666
Open your mouth.

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:33.291
He's shitting blood. Blood!

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.916
And he still won't
stop gorging on that junk.

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:40.749
Then he'll complain - Doctor,
the medicines aren't working!

00:20:44.374 --> 00:20:48.416
Nakul, could you just go and call Dad,
ask where he's reached?

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.499
Mom, let the check-up get over at least?

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.707
Do as I say, please...

00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:04.749
Bagga Uncle.
I had a... 'Lady-problem' as well.

00:21:05.541 --> 00:21:07.582
If you could call Aunty...

00:21:07.832 --> 00:21:09.416
Just for a check-up.

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:19.249
Hello Aunty...

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:20.249
Aunty?

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.999
What are you doing outside?

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:36.916
- I just couldn't reach your phone!
- How's Mom doing?

00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:38.124
Bagga and his wife
are both examining her.

00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:39.707
Okay... Take this, pay the fare.

00:21:40.457 --> 00:21:41.082
How much?

00:21:42.624 --> 00:21:43.749
Hello Doctor...

00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:45.666
The train halted at
Faridabad junction, so...

00:22:11.457 --> 00:22:12.707
Dad... Is everything okay?

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.541
Yes, it's all good, son...

00:22:14.832 --> 00:22:17.791
I mean, the doctor
suggested a few tests...

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:18.791
Tests?

00:22:19.082 --> 00:22:20.374
Yes, just regular ones...

00:22:20.874 --> 00:22:22.707
Mom wants you to head back home...

00:22:22.957 --> 00:22:24.707
Grandma will be back
from the prayer meet soon.

00:22:24.707 --> 00:22:28.207
If she finds the house locked, she'll
create a ruckus. Gular isn't home either.

00:22:28.791 --> 00:22:30.207
- So I'll leave?
- Yes.

00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.041
Just give me the car keys.

00:22:36.457 --> 00:22:37.332
What about Mom?

00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:39.874
She's perfectly fine... Don't worry!

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.874
You carry on.

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:46.332
Rickshaw, stop!

00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.582
Pregakem... Pregnancy Detection Kit.

00:22:59.874 --> 00:23:01.999
Don't be so surprised.

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:03.499
There have even been cases..

00:23:03.499 --> 00:23:06.791
...where the mother's only
realized at the time of delivery!

00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:08.499
Look it up online.

00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:12.457
Considering your age,
and because it's been detected late...

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:16.332
You'll need to decide
soon if you want an operation.

00:23:17.249 --> 00:23:21.207
Don't worry. Think it over for 2-4 days.

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:23.749
But don't delay it further.

00:23:24.249 --> 00:23:27.624
Or the risk will increase. Okay?

00:23:42.082 --> 00:23:43.749
I'm not getting an abortion.

00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:05.374
What do you mean?

00:24:07.082 --> 00:24:09.666
I mean, just think it over?

00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:16.082
Even the doctor said,
take 2-4 days and decide...

00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:17.666
It could be risky...

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:21.582
Whatever the risk, I'm sure about this.
I can't kill my child.

00:24:22.332 --> 00:24:24.707
Listen Babli... Why be stubborn?

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:28.749
At this age.
can your body bear this burden?

00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:33.124
Has my baby been a burden till now?

00:24:34.707 --> 00:24:36.374
There's no way I'm getting an abortion.

00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:39.457
I believe it's a sin.
You speak for yourself.

00:24:41.332 --> 00:24:46.749
All I'm asking is... can we handle this?

00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:50.957
Think about it, Babli.

00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:56.541
There'll be expenses,
so much responsibility... no?

00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:01.957
Fine.

00:25:03.707 --> 00:25:07.582
It's your body.
The final decision has to be yours too.

00:25:09.707 --> 00:25:10.707
Okay?

00:25:21.707 --> 00:25:23.124
Let's take a final call.

00:25:27.957 --> 00:25:29.249
You're sure, right?

00:25:29.582 --> 00:25:31.582
I've already told you... Why
are you asking again and again?

00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:37.957
Yes... Yes son.

00:25:37.957 --> 00:25:40.332
Yes, we're coming home.

00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:42.291
It's all fine. Yes.

00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:23.916
Will you tell us what Bagga
said? Everything's okay, right?

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:24.791
Yes...

00:26:26.457 --> 00:26:28.291
- Gular, why don't you come sit with us?
- No, I'm good here.

00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:30.041
Anyway, India's innings
begins in 5 minutes.

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:31.916
Oh, okay. What's the target?

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:33.874
271.

00:26:33.874 --> 00:26:35.457
Ah. Will we win?

00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:37.082
We'll watch and find out, right?

00:26:37.082 --> 00:26:39.582
You're worried about the match?
India's on a winning streak anyway!

00:26:39.582 --> 00:26:41.707
What's wrong with Mom?
I've been asking you for an hour!

00:26:42.332 --> 00:26:43.332
Is she fine?

00:26:43.332 --> 00:26:45.374
Yeah, that's why I called you guys here.

00:26:45.707 --> 00:26:49.791
Umm... Mom's been unwell
for the past few days, right?

00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:52.957
So the doctor got a few tests done...

00:26:53.457 --> 00:26:55.374
So the doctor said...

00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:57.957
The doctor said that...

00:26:59.416 --> 00:27:01.249
- We're expecting a guest at home.
- A guest?

00:27:01.541 --> 00:27:04.041
I'm not vacating my room, Dad!
I'm telling you already...

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:06.124
A 'little guest'.

00:27:09.832 --> 00:27:10.874
Little guest?

00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:22.957
- What little guest?
- That's what the doctor said...

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:41.541
Ma... Got back late from
the prayer meet today?

00:28:43.624 --> 00:28:44.832
Jeetu, son...

00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:48.874
Aren't you sleepy?

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:53.249
Ma, I needed to tell you something...

00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:55.207
Hmm... What is it?

00:28:56.374 --> 00:28:57.874
A little gently...

00:28:58.582 --> 00:28:59.707
Yes, Ma.

00:29:13.374 --> 00:29:14.957
“I want my own room,
I want my own room..."

00:29:14.957 --> 00:29:16.707
Wanted your own room, you brat?

00:29:20.624 --> 00:29:22.666
Couldn't sleep between
Mom and Dad for a few more years?

00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:24.291
So is it my fault?

00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:35.874
Ma, Priyamvada was feeling
ill for the past few days, so...

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:38.749
What do I tell you, Jeetu...

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:44.249
There's no illness worse than old age.

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:48.082
The body aches, and so does the heart...

00:29:48.457 --> 00:29:49.957
Oh Lord Almighty...

00:29:56.832 --> 00:30:01.041
Ma... She's carrying...

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:08.749
The Almighty is omnipotent...

00:30:11.874 --> 00:30:14.124
He controls everything.

00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:18.332
We all carry our own burden...

00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:23.499
The Guru told us at the prayer meet...

00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:26.791
Whatever life offers you...

00:30:27.332 --> 00:30:29.582
Accept it as His blessing.

00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:32.416
Don't ask questions.

00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:34.749
Don't stress yourself...

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:38.332
It's all God's will...

00:30:57.874 --> 00:31:00.374
Ma says it's God's will!

00:31:05.249 --> 00:31:09.957
Jeetu son, his blessings are upon you...

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.082
You guys are the limit!

00:31:59.457 --> 00:32:02.207
Eh! What happened to him?

00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:07.291
The water must be hot by now.

00:32:08.082 --> 00:32:11.791
Priyamvada... Keep the
bucket in the bathroom, will you?

00:32:12.416 --> 00:32:13.082
I'll keep it.

00:32:13.249 --> 00:32:16.666
Sit, where are you going! Let her do it.

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.707
Gular... go keep the bucket please.

00:32:18.874 --> 00:32:23.416
Let him eat in peace... Does
she have nail paint on?

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:25.624
Ma, didn't I tell you last night?

00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:28.999
What did you tell me?

00:32:44.582 --> 00:32:46.041
Gular... bolt the door, son.

00:32:49.749 --> 00:32:50.874
Where are you off?

00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.832
It's not such good news,
that I must hear it again!

00:32:54.249 --> 00:32:55.332
Good news?

00:32:56.124 --> 00:32:57.707
What did he say, Jeetu?

00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.499
Ma, I told you last night...

00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:03.999
What did you tell me?

00:33:10.374 --> 00:33:12.541
You're going to become a Grandmother...

00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:14.749
Can't hear you. Say it again?

00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:20.374
Priyamvada's expecting...

00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:23.249
As in?

00:33:25.249 --> 00:33:28.124
She... I mean, we going to have a baby.

00:33:30.332 --> 00:33:31.124
What?

00:33:38.874 --> 00:33:40.166
Jeetu..

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:46.416
Children are meant to bring
glory to their parents...

00:33:49.624 --> 00:33:52.624
But you didn't even
give your kids a chance!

00:33:53.916 --> 00:33:55.499
You'll make them famous!

00:33:56.707 --> 00:33:59.707
Everyone's going to say...

00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:06.916
Look at Jitender's kids,
cradling Jitender's kid!“

00:34:07.332 --> 00:34:12.291
He's old enough to have his own kid.
Now he'll be raising a baby brother!

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:21.957
I used to tease Nakul saying I'll die
only after I see a toddler in his arms...

00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:27.249
Looks like your wife took it seriously!

00:34:31.832 --> 00:34:36.457
Have you two abandoned all shame?
Completely?

00:34:40.124 --> 00:34:44.916
When I watch the holy sermons on TV,
you turn it off and switch to the news.

00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:47.041
Here's the result-

00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:49.666
Now you'll be on the news!

00:34:50.499 --> 00:34:56.541
Stand right here!
Look at me! Face me! Look this way.

00:34:59.457 --> 00:35:04.416
First of all, I want to know...
when did you find the time for this?

00:35:07.332 --> 00:35:09.666
You better give me an answer.

00:35:09.666 --> 00:35:15.416
When I ask you to sit and talk to me...

00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:18.499
...you always say you're exhausted...

00:35:18.874 --> 00:35:21.791
Actually, you're just
in a hurry to lock your door!

00:35:27.582 --> 00:35:32.541
Now I understand...

00:35:32.916 --> 00:35:35.916
Why her body aches every morning!

00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:38.041
Ma, you're blowing
this out of proportion...

00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:44.416
Well, you're a man after all, just
like your father. It's in your genes.

00:35:45.707 --> 00:35:52.916
But What about her, the doctor's
daughter... didn't she know better?

00:35:53.291 --> 00:35:58.332
Her sons are all grown up,
and she still flaunts lipstick!

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:09.749
Where are you running off? Stop!

00:36:10.374 --> 00:36:12.666
- Ma, we'll be back in 5 minutes.
- Listen to me!

00:36:12.957 --> 00:36:14.999
Where are you running off?

00:36:15.707 --> 00:36:17.832
- Mrs. Kaushik!
- I've had enough!

00:36:18.082 --> 00:36:20.124
Listen Bain... Babli!

00:36:20.374 --> 00:36:21.707
Mr. Kaushik!

00:36:21.707 --> 00:36:24.041
- Is everything fine?
- Mind your own business, mister!

00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:25.499
Please, Bain... stop!

00:36:31.332 --> 00:36:34.207
Look, don't spoil your mood.

00:36:35.291 --> 00:36:37.541
Thankfully she can't
go around without her walker...

00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:39.749
Or she'd have announced
it to the entire colony by now!

00:36:40.707 --> 00:36:45.332
You know how she is... her anger fizzes
out just as quickly as it explodes.

00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:47.957
She's probably forgotten about it by now.

00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:52.457
Forget about me... You didn't
even listen to the government!

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:57.041
On the radio, in the papers, on TV...

00:36:57.582 --> 00:37:04.541
They cried themselves hoarse on family
planning: "Two of us, two of ours!"

00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:08.541
Even I saw the ads...

00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:12.874
...and understood what protection means!

00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:14.999
And you guys didn't get it?

00:37:19.999 --> 00:37:21.666
Did I conceive this child alone?

00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:25.457
She promptly gave you a
clean chit...

00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:28.041
And tore me to shreds!

00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:31.749
"Look at the doctor's daughter,
flaunting lipstick..."

00:37:32.374 --> 00:37:34.082
Why get my father into this?

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:38.291
Amazing!

00:37:39.374 --> 00:37:42.082
And he's a government servant, to top it!

00:37:43.332 --> 00:37:46.124
It beats me...

00:37:46.749 --> 00:37:54.332
If he can't obey the government, how
has he worked for them all these years?

00:38:05.457 --> 00:38:07.957
Please Babli, don't be angry.

00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:14.791
It doesn't suit your pretty face.

00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:18.791
Don't you dare flatter me!

00:38:19.707 --> 00:38:21.916
This is exactly what has lead to this!

00:38:30.666 --> 00:38:31.749
What's the time?

00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:35.874
Turn back - let's go home.

00:38:36.499 --> 00:38:39.457
If Ma misses her medicines,
I'll be blamed for that too.

00:38:40.957 --> 00:38:43.082
The kids also left without
eating in the morning.

00:38:47.082 --> 00:38:48.082
Should I play a song?

00:38:48.082 --> 00:38:51.082
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

00:38:52.249 --> 00:38:53.999
<i>How did it happen?</i>

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.999
<i>When it happened...</i>

00:38:57.707 --> 00:38:59.499
<i>Now, what can one say?</i>

00:39:00.082 --> 00:39:03.166
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.874
<i>How did this happen?</i>

00:39:06.374 --> 00:39:10.582
<i>When it happened...
Why it happened...</i>

00:39:10.874 --> 00:39:14.582
<i>Well, it is what it is...</i>

00:39:19.332 --> 00:39:21.124
- Hello...
- Hi, where are you?

00:39:21.624 --> 00:39:22.999
I've been trying to call you...

00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:26.041
Your phone was off.
Messaged you at night, no reply...

00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:27.791
What's up - is everything okay?

00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:28.916
How's Aunty?

00:39:30.332 --> 00:39:31.916
I'll call you later.

00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:33.332
- Nakul?
- Okay, bye.

00:39:33.749 --> 00:39:34.582
What the...

00:39:34.582 --> 00:39:38.874
<i>Let it go, don't fret about it...</i>

00:39:40.082 --> 00:39:43.249
<i>Alas, what just happened?</i>

00:40:00.707 --> 00:40:01.332
He's back.

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.124
Don't you dare lock the door!

00:40:11.082 --> 00:40:12.749
Can I turn off the lights?

00:40:25.499 --> 00:40:29.999
<i>Congrats my dear, congrats to you!</i>

00:40:31.499 --> 00:40:34.916
- Are you drunk early morning?
- It's not like that...

00:40:34.916 --> 00:40:37.041
Virender? Are you talking to Virender?

00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:39.582
It's all thanks to your mushy poetry!

00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:41.874
- Give me the phone...
- Listen, Ma wants to talk...

00:40:41.874 --> 00:40:43.166
I want to speak to him...

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.666
<i>- “render?
- What happened?</i>

00:40:46.332 --> 00:40:47.332
They did it!

00:40:48.249 --> 00:40:49.082
What?

00:40:49.082 --> 00:40:50.166
They did it again!

00:40:51.124 --> 00:40:52.041
- Hello?

00:40:52.041 --> 00:40:55.457
<i>- To the Fem, to the Gran,
To the Daddy and his clan</i>

00:40:55.457 --> 00:40:57.999
<i>Congrats to them too!</i>

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:00.999
It got disconnected, Ma.

00:41:02.707 --> 00:41:03.832
Good morning.

00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:07.791
Mr Kaushik!

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:09.666
Is everything fine?

00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:13.041
Very well, thanks... How about you?

00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:14.291
All good!

00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:15.749
It's time for my train, so...

00:41:15.749 --> 00:41:18.707
<i>Tried giving a missed call
But damn, it got received!</i>

00:41:18.707 --> 00:41:20.499
Not as innocent as he looks, is he?

00:41:21.249 --> 00:41:23.457
At least he does more
than just snore in bed!

00:41:25.624 --> 00:41:31.749
So, the easiest and most effective
method of contraception is the condom...

00:41:33.666 --> 00:41:35.749
- What is it?
- Condom!

00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:39.124
What will he do?
Embarrass us, what else.

00:41:39.374 --> 00:41:40.999
We'll have to hand him
everything on a platter.

00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:42.499
I'll have to use up my retirement fund!

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:44.166
Nakul never gave us any trouble.

00:41:45.499 --> 00:41:47.332
Especially when it came to studies.

00:41:49.332 --> 00:41:50.207
Gular!

00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:10.374
Oh, congratulations!

00:42:10.374 --> 00:42:12.374
Shh! Get inside.

00:42:12.374 --> 00:42:13.749
Come here.

00:42:16.124 --> 00:42:17.582
Congrats!

00:42:18.416 --> 00:42:20.207
Bagga couldn't keep it under wraps!

00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:24.082
Anyway, how long could
you've kept this under wraps?

00:42:25.749 --> 00:42:27.624
By God, I'm so jealous!

00:42:29.374 --> 00:42:33.582
- Look at her blush!
Congrats Missus, Congrats to you!

00:42:33.582 --> 00:42:37.332
<i>Congrats Missus, Congrats to you!</i>

- Nakull

00:42:46.291 --> 00:42:50.374
<i>Here you are ramshackled
Completely past retrieval</i>

00:42:50.374 --> 00:42:52.874
<i>The news is all over the place!</i>

00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:56.207

00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:58.707

00:43:01.916 --> 00:43:02.957
- Hello Aunty!
- Hello.

00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:04.249
Is Nakul around?

00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:06.166
No, he left for office...

00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:07.082
Why don't you come in?

00:43:07.082 --> 00:43:09.082
- It's okay, Aunty... I'll call him up.
- Okay...

00:43:09.082 --> 00:43:10.791
- How are you?
- Very well...

00:43:11.916 --> 00:43:12.874
Hello Aunty!

00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:14.999
Is Nakul home?

00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:16.541
No son, he's not back yet.

00:43:17.332 --> 00:43:19.082
Okay Aunty. Tell him I came over.

00:43:33.457 --> 00:43:37.582
<i>Swollen so much with joy

00:43:54.374 --> 00:43:56.332
Congrats, Mr Kaushik!

00:43:56.832 --> 00:43:59.124
Many, many congrats!

00:43:59.124 --> 00:44:00.124
Congratulations!

00:44:00.457 --> 00:44:02.541

00:44:36.832 --> 00:44:38.916
No ginger in the tea for you,
it can cause acidity.

00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:40.749
Add cardamom instead?

00:44:41.249 --> 00:44:42.166
Let me check.

00:44:50.749 --> 00:44:51.707
Hello Aunty.

00:44:51.707 --> 00:44:52.457
Hello...

00:44:53.166 --> 00:44:54.374
You are?

00:44:54.374 --> 00:44:56.499
Aunty, I'm Reneé...Nakul's colleague.

00:44:56.499 --> 00:44:57.791
We go to office together...

00:44:57.791 --> 00:44:59.916
Yes, of course! Please come in.

00:45:00.207 --> 00:45:01.874
Heard so much about you...

00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:03.666
But we've never met,
so didn't recognize you.

00:45:04.041 --> 00:45:05.624
Come, have a seat.

00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:06.541
These are for you, Aunty.

00:45:06.749 --> 00:45:09.124
Oh... Thank you.

00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:10.499
Please sit!

00:45:16.332 --> 00:45:17.166
Nakul!

00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:19.874
He went for a bath,
must be getting dressed!

00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:21.624
Okay, he'll be here.

00:45:22.374 --> 00:45:23.916
How are you feeling now, Aunty'?

00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:25.416
I'm fine.

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:31.166
Nakul didn't come to office all
week and wasn't answering his phone...

00:45:31.166 --> 00:45:33.124
So I thought I'd drop by to check.

00:45:34.207 --> 00:45:34.957
Oh, is it?

00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:37.082
Hello Uncle.

00:45:37.082 --> 00:45:40.999
Renee... She and Nakul
go to office together...

00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:42.332
Oh yes.

00:45:43.332 --> 00:45:45.291
Good, good... very good.

00:45:46.207 --> 00:45:48.291
Why are you standing up? Sit down.

00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:52.166
Tea?

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.332
No, Uncle... Thank you.

00:45:53.332 --> 00:45:54.916
Little tea? I made.

00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:56.416
I don't drink tea.

00:45:56.416 --> 00:45:59.957
I want to give it up too, but I can't
clear my bowels without my morning tea!

00:46:04.832 --> 00:46:07.041
You're working together
with Nakul, right?

00:46:08.582 --> 00:46:09.999
<i>Same</i> pay scale?

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:11.041
Enough, already!

00:46:12.124 --> 00:46:13.082
Yes, uncle.

00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.082
I am... Northern Railways...
Ticket inspector.

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:19.082
Nakul... Your friend!

00:46:20.207 --> 00:46:22.541
I'm offering tea, but she's not taking.

00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:23.874
- Very shy...
- Yeah, okay.

00:46:24.457 --> 00:46:25.999
Why are you talking in English?

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:30.416
If you'd like some cola,
Nakul can quickly go and get it.

00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:32.791
We don't keep the big bottles at home...

00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:35.416
Once opened, it loses its fizz.
Gets wasted.

00:46:36.082 --> 00:46:38.582
- Would you like sherbet instead?
- Mom we don't have time.

00:46:38.582 --> 00:46:40.499
We have an urgent meeting,
that's why she's here.

00:46:40.499 --> 00:46:41.874
We have to leave right now. Let's go.

00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:43.874
Aunty... We're already running late...

00:46:43.874 --> 00:46:45.124
Come again, okay?

00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:45.999
Yes, aunty.

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:47.832
At least leave your towel behind!

00:46:49.582 --> 00:46:50.582
Always in a hurry...

00:46:50.582 --> 00:46:51.791
Where are you off to?

00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:53.249
Putting the towel out to dry.

00:46:53.707 --> 00:46:55.374
She looks Punjabi, no?

00:46:56.749 --> 00:46:58.916
Thank you for paying visit!

00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:19.957
Couldn't you tell me before coming?

00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:21.791
It's my fault?

00:47:22.457 --> 00:47:23.791
Fine, I won't come again.

00:47:24.207 --> 00:47:25.249
Am I saying that?

00:47:25.457 --> 00:47:28.082
Shouldn't you have told
me before you disappeared?

00:47:29.207 --> 00:47:31.749
Of course I told Vikrant
I'd be on leave for a few days.

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:32.749
How does Vikrant matter?

00:47:32.749 --> 00:47:34.541
- He's my boss, isn't he?
- What about me?

00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:35.707
Don't I deserve to know?

00:47:35.874 --> 00:47:38.041
You're not responding
to my calls and messages...

00:47:38.041 --> 00:47:39.416
Everyone's been asking me...

00:47:39.416 --> 00:47:40.832
Even Vikrant's been asking me...

00:47:40.832 --> 00:47:42.707
"What happened,
is everything okay at his place?"

00:47:47.624 --> 00:47:50.582
And if you're so uncomfortable
with me meeting your parents...

00:47:50.832 --> 00:47:52.582
Fine. Let's call it quits.

00:47:52.582 --> 00:47:54.874
Am I saying that?
You're taking off on another tangent!

00:47:54.874 --> 00:47:57.041
So then tell me, what's the problem. Now.

00:48:03.124 --> 00:48:05.082
Well, my mum...

00:48:06.541 --> 00:48:07.707
Mum's pregnant.

00:48:07.707 --> 00:48:09.707
So are there any complications
in the pregnancy?

00:48:12.416 --> 00:48:13.666
Wait a minute.

00:48:14.582 --> 00:48:15.957
Who's pregnant?

00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:20.666
- Mum as in, your mum?
- Who else's, yours?

00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:23.124
While other parents arrange
their sons' marriages...

00:48:23.124 --> 00:48:24.832
...mine are arranging
for the Sarbala too!

00:48:25.791 --> 00:48:26.999
<i>'Sarbala'?</i>

00:48:27.707 --> 00:48:30.499
The little kid who rides with
the groom on horseback at our weddings!

00:48:54.082 --> 00:48:55.457
<i>Sarbala!</i>

00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:02.874
Nakul...

00:49:05.374 --> 00:49:07.707
I was laughing at the Sarbala joke.

00:49:07.707 --> 00:49:09.332
Nothing else is funny.

00:49:10.499 --> 00:49:11.666
Stop laughing.

00:49:12.624 --> 00:49:13.791
Stop laughing.

00:49:20.416 --> 00:49:21.124
Sorry.

00:49:27.666 --> 00:49:28.457
Done?

00:49:30.332 --> 00:49:32.166
Listen, I hope you didn't tell
your mum that I've not been in office?

00:49:42.249 --> 00:49:43.541
I'll get the door.

00:49:52.082 --> 00:49:57.499
Nakul... She's the one
you go to office with, right?

00:49:58.416 --> 00:50:01.416
She's very sweet...
What's her name, again?

00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:02.082
Reneé.

00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:03.332
Yes, Reneé!

00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:04.916
Listen son...

00:50:06.749 --> 00:50:08.999
Had you taken leave from office?

00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:09.999
Yes.

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.707
We have to leave for Meerut in two weeks,
for Shanoo's wedding, 30...

00:50:14.874 --> 00:50:17.207
It won't be a problem
taking leave then, would it?

00:50:17.207 --> 00:50:18.291
Mom, I'm not going.

00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:20.666
How can you say that?
It's Shanoo's wedding!

00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:22.791
Because I've decided - I can't go.

00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:23.999
There's lots of work in office.

00:50:24.207 --> 00:50:26.582
What nonsense! Have you gone nuts?

00:50:26.874 --> 00:50:29.291
What will your aunt think,
what will people say?

00:50:31.082 --> 00:50:33.541
Shouldn't you have thought of that?

00:50:35.124 --> 00:50:36.707
Of What people will say?

00:50:39.207 --> 00:50:40.624
What did you say?

00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:42.832
Where are his manners?

00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:43.999
Is this how you talk to your father?

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:46.041
I'll... talk to him.

00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:47.124
What will you tell him?

00:50:49.666 --> 00:50:50.749
What about you?

00:50:50.749 --> 00:50:51.916
Will you be coming?

00:50:53.499 --> 00:50:57.207
I already told Ma...
My final year exams are round the corner.

00:50:57.207 --> 00:50:58.499
- I'll explain...
- No! Enough.

00:50:58.999 --> 00:51:00.832
You needn't plead with anyone.

00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:03.082
Jeetu!

00:52:03.082 --> 00:52:04.166
Chawla!

00:52:05.082 --> 00:52:06.916
How are you, brother?

00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:08.207
You haven't changed one bit!

00:52:08.624 --> 00:52:09.916
- How are you?
- Very well.

00:52:09.916 --> 00:52:10.874
Hello!

00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:15.166
Jeetu, give me your bag.

00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.499
It's okay - it's not heavy.

00:52:16.499 --> 00:52:18.041
Ma, remember Chawla?

00:52:18.624 --> 00:52:19.582
Hello Aunty.

00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.957
Where did your hair disappear?

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:24.499
Let's get going.

00:52:25.499 --> 00:52:27.541
Babli, get in from the other side.

00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:29.166
Counted the luggage?

00:52:29.707 --> 00:52:31.457
No, no! You don't have to pay him.

00:52:31.457 --> 00:52:32.874
- He's from our staff... It's his job!
- Never mind.

00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:34.332
Give it back!

00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:40.374
Chawla, the clock tower stills
looks the same!

00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:43.999
- Hasn't changed a bit!
- Meerut need not change.

00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:48.541
You checked the spelling
of 'Welcome', right?

00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:50.166
It's correct, sir- I've checked.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.041
- Just Google and confirm it once.
- Okay, sir.

00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:54.207
Arrange it in a line, son.

00:52:54.582 --> 00:52:55.791
Jeetu's here?

00:52:56.124 --> 00:52:57.999
Go tell Guddan, Jeetu's arrived!

00:52:57.999 --> 00:52:59.082
They've reached.

00:53:00.124 --> 00:53:02.749
Jeetu's finally here... Jeetu!

00:53:02.749 --> 00:53:04.207
Welcome!

00:53:04.207 --> 00:53:05.249
Many congrats!

00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:06.999
And double-congrats to you!

00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:09.707
Hello Aunty, please come!

00:53:10.374 --> 00:53:11.916
Hello.

00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:13.041
Banwari's decorating the venue, is it?

00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:14.499
Ah, you remember, I see!

00:53:14.999 --> 00:53:16.916
The decoration looks tip-top, doesn't it?

00:53:16.916 --> 00:53:18.749
It looks amazing.

00:53:18.749 --> 00:53:20.624
This is what one earns for, right?

00:53:20.624 --> 00:53:22.332
Look Jiji,
his Sari doesn't have any lining!

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:28.291
- Guddan, look who's here!
- He's here?

00:53:28.874 --> 00:53:30.749
Chhotu, go collect the luggage!

00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:33.041
God bless! How are you?

00:53:33.666 --> 00:53:35.041
God bless!

00:53:35.207 --> 00:53:37.332
Ma! How are you?

00:53:37.332 --> 00:53:39.541
Come Priyam...

00:53:40.374 --> 00:53:43.832
I've been waiting to see you
ever since I heard the good news!

00:53:46.582 --> 00:53:47.874
How are you, Priyam?

00:53:52.416 --> 00:53:53.874
The boys didn't come?

00:53:55.832 --> 00:54:01.124
The thing is... Gular's
exams are coming up, so...

00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:02.749
What about Nakul?

00:54:03.249 --> 00:54:05.457
Some important office work came up...

00:54:07.207 --> 00:54:08.166
That's not done.

00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:11.124
What could be more important
than his sister's wedding?

00:54:11.124 --> 00:54:14.832
Let it go... Don't ruin your
mood at your daughter's wedding.

00:54:14.832 --> 00:54:18.207
Will you let us in,
or are we having a seminar right here?

00:54:18.874 --> 00:54:21.666
Guddan, get them tea.
Let's talk inside...

00:54:21.666 --> 00:54:23.249
Come, slowly...

00:54:33.207 --> 00:54:34.041
Come.

00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:36.916
No, there's lots of
work today... I'll be late.

00:54:39.124 --> 00:54:41.332
Okay... I'll leave then.

00:54:41.332 --> 00:54:42.207
Yeah carry on.

00:54:42.832 --> 00:54:46.416
Mom's on tour and
the maid's on leave too.

00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:48.666
There's no one at home.

00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:51.041
I guess I'll have to
cook and clean by myself.

00:54:51.457 --> 00:54:52.624
No one's home?

00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:56.249
Just wait five minutes...
I'll tell Vikrant...

00:54:56.249 --> 00:54:57.416
Where is Vikrant?

00:55:00.916 --> 00:55:02.249
I'll help you with the cooking.

00:55:02.749 --> 00:55:03.624
Cool.

00:55:07.207 --> 00:55:08.499
Wait!

00:55:10.332 --> 00:55:11.874
Tell Vikrant an emergency came up.

00:55:36.249 --> 00:55:39.041
<i>Your Lover, he's ready</i>

00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:42.291
<i>In your captivity</i>

00:55:43.374 --> 00:55:45.832
<i>At least take a glance</i>

00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:49.291
<i>At what his eyes say</i>

00:55:50.832 --> 00:55:52.541

<i>At least take a glance</i>

00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:57.416
<i>At what his eyes say</i>

00:55:57.416 --> 00:56:00.666

<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:56:10.874 --> 00:56:12.666
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

<i>His badgering is persistent</i>

<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:18.457
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:56:47.707 --> 00:56:49.499
<i>Talks crazy, walks crazy</i>

00:56:49.499 --> 00:56:51.332
<i>On cloud-nine in a tizzy</i>

00:56:51.332 --> 00:56:54.416
<i>Eager beaver, Perfumed and ready</i>

00:56:54.416 --> 00:56:56.707
<i>Talks in tricky seductive lies</i>

00:56:56.707 --> 00:56:58.499
<i>Sweet talks and calls me baby</i>

00:56:58.499 --> 00:57:01.166
<i>Eager beaver, Mint breath ready</i>

00:57:01.166 --> 00:57:03.916
<i>Puppy eyes, Pretends to cry</i>

00:57:03.916 --> 00:57:05.707
<i>Avoids my eyes, He nudges sly</i>

00:57:05.707 --> 00:57:09.041
<i>Says Honey, come closer to me</i>

00:57:09.041 --> 00:57:10.999
<i>His passions overflow, he said</i>

00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:12.874
<i>Tonight we're gonna wrestle in bed</i>

00:57:12.874 --> 00:57:15.916
<i>Turn it on and come to me baby!</i>

00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:19.332
<i>Give me a yes, and take my life</i>

00:57:19.332 --> 00:57:22.457
<i>Darling, don't make no more excuses!</i>

00:57:22.457 --> 00:57:24.207
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.999
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:57:25.999 --> 00:57:27.832
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:27.832 --> 00:57:29.624
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:57:29.624 --> 00:57:31.374
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:31.374 --> 00:57:33.041
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:34.957
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:34.957 --> 00:57:36.707
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:57:36.707 --> 00:57:38.499
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:40.249
<i>His badgering is persistent</i>

00:57:40.249 --> 00:57:42.041
<i>My sentimental lover</i>

00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:43.957
<i>Counts backwards in excitement</i>

00:58:19.874 --> 00:58:20.749
What happened?

00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:23.499
Everything okay?

00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:27.499
Nakul?

00:58:29.707 --> 00:58:30.749
Say something!

00:58:30.749 --> 00:58:31.999
Okay, you tell me...

00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:35.207
Are parents supposed
to be doing all this?

00:58:43.124 --> 00:58:45.874
Are you going to sing,
or will you just clap your hands?

00:58:53.166 --> 00:58:55.124
Chhotu, listen!

00:58:55.124 --> 00:58:57.082
I'll be back in a moment, Aunty!

00:58:58.874 --> 00:59:00.999
He's gotten really spoilt!

00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:03.499
What are you saying, Mr Chopra!

00:59:06.166 --> 00:59:08.374
Business isn't that great these days!

00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:09.916
Chhotu's here.

00:59:09.916 --> 00:59:11.624
Keep the kebabs here.

00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:14.249
Aunty doesn't know, right?

00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:16.457
- Not at all, Uncle!
- Great.

00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:17.749
Go serve them, son.

00:59:25.124 --> 00:59:26.749
Jeetu, to tell you the truth...

00:59:27.249 --> 00:59:28.999
Sunny's ex-wife had an affair.

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:30.457
What are you saying!

00:59:30.999 --> 00:59:37.124
She pushed him away, and then divorced
him on false grounds of impotence!

00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:43.999
It destroyed the
poor boy's confidence.

00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.749
Did you take him to a doctor?

00:59:47.999 --> 00:59:49.082
We did.

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:52.124
It's been two years
since his second marriage.

00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:55.332
- We're still waiting to get
some 'good news'! - What?

00:59:55.541 --> 00:59:56.832
No good news yet!

00:59:58.374 --> 01:00:00.624
He feels shy talking to me.

01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:03.999
So I thought,
maybe you could speak to him?

01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:05.999
He respects you a lot.

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:07.457
Does he even recognize me?

01:00:07.874 --> 01:00:09.707
I only saw him as a baby
during his naming ceremony...

01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:12.374
...and at his first wedding,
Where we barely met for 2 minutes.

01:00:12.624 --> 01:00:14.082
How can I talk to him?

01:00:14.249 --> 01:00:16.707
If not you, who else do I ask?

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:20.124
Hey Chawla, come here!

01:01:04.874 --> 01:01:06.374
What's up!

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:08.749
Jeetu!

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:10.749
Having fun, eh?

01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:57.624
Nice! Look at you,
trying to look like a cool cat!

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:00.374
So while I struggle
to hide my belly...

01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:02.749
You'll strut around
twirling your whiskers?

01:03:05.041 --> 01:03:08.707
Don't forget, you own sons
are looking down upon you!

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.207
What are you staring at?
Shave them off!

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:15.207
Now!

01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:19.874
- Can I keep them until we're in Delhi?
- Do it now.

01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:26.999
Didn't your cousin have a moustache
as well? The one who went to Brazil?

01:03:52.249 --> 01:03:53.374
Will you say something?

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:57.749
I really want to understand
What your problem is, Nakul.

01:03:57.999 --> 01:03:59.749
If you still haven't understood,
there's no point.

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:01.207
Explain it, then!

01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:03.707
Do you find it embarrassing
that your parents have sex?

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.624
I don't want to discuss this.
Don't you understand?

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:08.707
I don't want to either.

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:10.624
It's just that it's
starting to affect us.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:12.624
Reneé!

01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:19.707
What?

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:21.374
What do you want?

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:26.207
Do you want your parents to
take your permission - "Son, can we?“

01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:32.624
Okay, I'm confused.

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:35.582
Suppose we get married...

01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:38.749
How do you think we'd
be in our 403 and 503?

01:04:38.999 --> 01:04:39.624
What do you mean?

01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:43.082
I mean, will we only discuss
our kids' school grades?

01:04:43.999 --> 01:04:46.832
Instead of Pink Floyd,
will we listen to devotional songs?

01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:48.249
No sex, no romance?

01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:53.499
Because if that's your idea
of being married, then count me out.

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.832
Honestly, that's not the life I want.

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.207
Sorry, sorry.

01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:04.624
Here's your mixed popcorn.

01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:17.582
You know, when I was six or seven,
I was terrified of the dark.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:21.249
So I slept between Mom and Dad.

01:05:22.666 --> 01:05:25.749
Sometimes, I'd wake up at
night and find them both missing.

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:31.624
I was telling you about Mom and Dad...

01:05:33.666 --> 01:05:35.999
- Obviously, they'd be In the next room.
- What?

01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:37.874
They'd be in the next room!

01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:42.541
I was too young. 80 I would get scared
and start banging on the door...

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:43.624
Can you imagine?

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:46.332
Mom would always open the door...

01:05:47.249 --> 01:05:49.499
And I clearly remember
the look on her face.

01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:50.499
What?

01:05:51.124 --> 01:05:55.624
“Reneé, are you fine?"
Dad would never come out.

01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:59.374
Some 2-3 years back,
I discussed this with Mom...

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:02.624
And we laughed so hard.
It was so funny!

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:07.582
Man, how can you discuss
all this with your mum?

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:10.582
Girls can discuss anything
with their mothers.

01:06:12.374 --> 01:06:13.999
In that case, I'm happy being a guy.

01:06:14.249 --> 01:06:17.749
Locking my parents up and banging
on the door isn't my idea of fun!

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:21.124
Very funny...
You aren't as smart as you think.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.374
Otherwise you wouldn't
have been acting so juvenile!

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:31.582
Now I understand
What your problem is...

01:06:31.999 --> 01:06:33.374
What is my problem?

01:06:34.499 --> 01:06:36.124
You're like a typical Indian man!

01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:38.749
Turn your mother into a Goddess.

01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:40.332
Put her on a pedestal.

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:43.916
And forget that she's also
a wife and a woman with desires.

01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:47.499
Hold on. Don't try
to intellectualize this.

01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:49.832
Put yourself in my shoes.

01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:52.749
If your mom got pregnant,
you'd know how it feels.

01:06:57.041 --> 01:06:59.582
If my mom got pregnant,
it would be a bigger problem...

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:01.124
See!

01:07:02.124 --> 01:07:03.499
Yeah... Because my Dad's no more!

01:07:09.249 --> 01:07:10.124
Pass the salt!

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.999
By the way, have you told your mom?

01:07:19.291 --> 01:07:20.124
Not yet.

01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:22.749
You can tell her yourself.

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:25.207
It's her 50th birthday tomorrow.
There's a party...

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:27.582
And you're my special invitee.

01:07:37.124 --> 01:07:38.624
You've got to come, okay?

01:08:14.416 --> 01:08:15.749
Where did I keep it...

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.874
Bro, my tuition fee's due.
Mom left without giving it to me.

01:08:19.874 --> 01:08:21.624
'Bro'? Are you okay?

01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:23.207
How much?

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:24.624
2500 rupees.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:25.999
Man...

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.374
Looking for your phone?

01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:29.707
What's it doing with you?

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:34.624
I don't have the cash...

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:35.957
Take my card.

01:08:36.124 --> 01:08:37.124
What's the PIN?

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:42.582
Actually, give it back...

01:08:45.874 --> 01:08:47.832
Come with me.
We'll pick up cash on the way.

01:08:54.624 --> 01:08:55.332
Here.

01:08:57.541 --> 01:08:58.707
What are you doing?

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:00.499
Yeah, coming...

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.207
Mom didn't give me
pocket money either.

01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:23.957
Chotu, hurry up...

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:26.499
Here. You can clear my tab.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.041
You still owe me a grand!

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.499
I've given you 1500, right? I'll
pay the rest too. Give me a samosa.

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:45.332
Hey Gular! Come here.

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.249
Hi... How are you?

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:10.999
This is for you...

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:12.624
By 10 o'clock, I'm out...
Lights out...

01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.499
- Without telling me. she...
- Thank you!

01:10:17.791 --> 01:10:18.999
Ma, you want something?

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:20.374
Maybe this, later!

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.541
I'll just be back in a moment.

01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:24.999
You have to try this cake.
It's from this special...

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:25.749
Hello.

01:10:29.499 --> 01:10:31.124
Flowers are allowed today, right?

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:33.832
Come, I'll make you meet Mom.

01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:36.749
- Hi Aunty.
- Hello, son!

01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:38.082
Happy Birthday.

01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:40.249
Oh thank you, they're gorgeous.
Thank you!

01:10:40.249 --> 01:10:41.749
In fact, this party's gorgeous.

01:10:41.749 --> 01:10:43.249
That's all her doing.

01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.624
Who celebrates birthdays
like this when they're 50!

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:46.874
Mom, not again.

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:48.499
I'm not complaining!

01:10:48.916 --> 01:10:50.707
Give him some cake...

01:10:50.999 --> 01:10:52.874
He doesn't drink, no? So cake?

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:53.624
I do!

01:10:57.874 --> 01:10:58.832
Boyfriend?

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.499
Don't diet, have the cake.

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:08.124
It's not too casual, is it?

01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:10.332
How did you get so late?

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:13.249
You got out of office
early saying it's your Mom's birthday.

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:15.332
What excuse could I
give, my sister's wedding?

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.624
What date is it?

01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:21.499
10th December.

01:11:22.124 --> 01:11:23.749
Damn, it's Shanoo's wedding today.

01:11:24.499 --> 01:11:25.624
You didn't even call?

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.999
That's Mr Chawla's son.

01:12:18.374 --> 01:12:19.624
Go ahead, counsel him.

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:36.874
Come. Let's go for the photograph.

01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:52.957
Shanoo, I'm so sorry. I really am!

01:12:53.249 --> 01:12:57.499
Say sorry all you want. When you
get married, I won't attend either!

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:59.207
I just got stuck
With some office work...

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:01.499
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:04.999
Okay listen, your mom's here.
Speak to her.

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:06.707
Nakul...

01:13:08.291 --> 01:13:08.999
Hello?

01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:15.332
The call disconnected...

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.999
- Excuse me. Do you have a charger?
- Yeah.

01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:31.166
My phone just died.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:32.791
I'll put it on charge. Excuse me.

01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:33.499
Sure.

01:13:34.624 --> 01:13:36.374
<i>- Nah“.
- Ron. How are you?</i>

01:13:36.666 --> 01:13:37.499
I'm good.

01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:44.082
Shanoo, Granny...

01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:52.749
God bless you.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:59.291
You're going to America, right?
Stay happy.

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:02.499
Granny, I'll call you from there!

01:14:02.666 --> 01:14:03.999
It's okay, my child.

01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:06.749
None of you bothered
to call me from Meerut...

01:14:06.749 --> 01:14:08.666
How will you keep
in touch from America?

01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:09.999
It'll be too much trouble.

01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:12.499
Start the band!

01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:13.749
Play the music!

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:16.249
At least let me give her my blessings!

01:14:16.541 --> 01:14:18.666
Why don't you relax, Ma?

01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:19.999
What did I say wrong?

01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:34.124
Let's never invite the Sethis again.

01:14:34.124 --> 01:14:35.916
They guzzled down all the wine!

01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:38.499
Did you see him staring at his wife?

01:14:40.166 --> 01:14:42.832
Kundan Singh!
Put out the candles.

01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:48.499
Can't host these parties anymore.
It's too much.

01:14:48.916 --> 01:14:50.999
Mom. I need to talk to you.

01:14:59.374 --> 01:15:00.374
She's what?

01:15:01.416 --> 01:15:02.499
How?

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:04.374
I think, how it usually happens.

01:15:05.666 --> 01:15:07.749
So you think this is a joke?

01:15:08.374 --> 01:15:10.207
It's no big deal, mom.

01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:12.957
'It's no big deal'?

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.874
My God!

01:15:18.499 --> 01:15:20.999
How can people be so careless!

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:25.207
No, I understand, I mean...

01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.957
'A moment of passion' and all, but...

01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:31.249
What about later?
How can you not take any precautions?

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:37.874
Okay so, when they found out...

01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:39.082
Was there time?

01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:42.457
I'm not sure, but maybe there was.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:45.874
Oh God...

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:49.249
Well I don't know
What to say then, Reneé!

01:15:49.666 --> 01:15:50.749
"Maybe there was?"

01:15:51.374 --> 01:15:54.499
God, it's embarrassing
to say the least, isn't it?

01:15:55.374 --> 01:15:58.124
And the health risk?
Did they consider it?

01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:01.749
And the financial strain...

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.249
Especially when they're
close to retirement!

01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:07.749
And it's not like
they're so well off...

01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:10.249
Heights!

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:14.999
Do you realize who is going
to bear the strain of all this?

01:16:15.499 --> 01:16:17.707
<i>- Ma...
- Nah“ M“ be tapped in this mess.</i>

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:22.541
Reneé, if you're thinking
of a life with him...

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:26.874
Then have no doubt - this kid
is going to be your responsibility.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:27.874
Mom!

01:16:28.374 --> 01:16:31.207
Look Reneé,
I'm not saying Nakul's a bad guy.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:32.874
He's a nice boy.

01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:35.457
But his family, my God...

01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:40.207
You know, his family is a circus
I don't want to buy tickets to!

01:16:40.416 --> 01:16:45.374
It's just so... It's just so uncouth,
all this!

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:49.749
Can you imagine something like
this happening in families like ours?

01:16:49.916 --> 01:16:52.249
Come on, Mom!
You're being really harsh.

01:16:54.749 --> 01:16:56.624
Okay, but...

01:16:57.916 --> 01:17:00.374
You're all I have, Reneé.

01:17:01.499 --> 01:17:05.207
Nothing matters more
to me than your happiness.

01:17:05.999 --> 01:17:07.499
But think about it...

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:10.332
Would you be able to fit
into a family like theirs?

01:17:11.499 --> 01:17:13.207
They won't even let
their son move to the US.

01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:15.499
Won't they interfere in your life?

01:17:15.749 --> 01:17:17.624
And now they definitely
won't let him go...

01:17:17.624 --> 01:17:19.374
Because who'll provide
for them otherwise?

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:22.499
I had forgotten my phone.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:27.124
- Aunty, just a minute.
- Nakul!

01:17:27.374 --> 01:17:28.249
- No...
- Please.

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:29.749
I'm sorry Aunty.

01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:34.374
You were saying such nice things about
my family... I just eavesdropped.

01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:39.874
Then again - in families like ours,
listening in on others is quite normal.

01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:41.249
It is normal, yeah.

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:44.124
In fact,
I'm glad I heard what you said.

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:47.874
I just realized that I was
pointlessly getting embarrassed

01:17:48.124 --> 01:17:49.582
about Mom's pregnancy.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.249
Why bother?

01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:55.374
After all, our family's
already such an embarrassment!

01:17:56.874 --> 01:17:58.082
That's what you said, right?

01:17:58.666 --> 01:18:00.999
Not a family but... what was the word?

01:18:00.999 --> 01:18:02.874
Circus. Circus!

01:18:02.874 --> 01:18:05.624
Nakul, don't do this. You're drunk.

01:18:05.999 --> 01:18:07.124
At least let me talk?

01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:08.749
Is this the way to talk?

01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:10.874
Well, that's how we
talk in my family, isn't it?

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:13.374
We're a nosy bunch.

01:18:13.874 --> 01:18:15.999
By the way, about the interference...
you were bang on!

01:18:18.416 --> 01:18:19.999
My parents have issues
with me going to the US...

01:18:20.166 --> 01:18:21.749
I have issues with
their relationship...

01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:25.249
After all, what kind of man
loves his wife- it's so not classy!

01:18:26.291 --> 01:18:27.707
Better flirt with the
neighbour's wife, right?

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:28.874
Oh please...

01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:30.124
Just a minute,
Aunty - I'm not done yet.

01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:31.499
Nakul, don't misbehave.

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.249
It's okay, let him speak.

01:18:33.499 --> 01:18:34.207
Hmm.

01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:37.499
So kind of you, Aunty.

01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:44.749
You said I'm a 'nice guy'... right?

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:49.332
That's Where you got
it a little wrong.

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:54.374
If I were a nice guy,
I would've stood by my parents.

01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:58.249
If I were a nice guy,
I would've been happy for the baby.

01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:03.374
Because I know my parents will
give it all the love in the world.

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:09.832
And for whatever else it needs,
I'll be there.

01:19:12.041 --> 01:19:15.499
Because Whether it's a brother
or a sister, it'll be mine.

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:20.832
Done?

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:23.624
Yeah... I guess.

01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:26.749
That's all for now.

01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:29.999
I'll email you the rest.

01:19:30.749 --> 01:19:31.707
I'll take down your ID.

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:34.749
Goodnight, Aunty.

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:41.749
Nakul...

01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:43.749
Nakul!

01:19:44.499 --> 01:19:45.832
You can't talk to my mom like this.

01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:47.207
Why? Why can't I?

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:50.124
After all she said about my family,
why should I keep quiet?

01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:52.666
She was talking to me, not to you.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:54.124
How does it matter?

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.249
That's what she really
thinks of my family, isn't it?

01:19:57.499 --> 01:19:58.624
You've got to apologize to her.

01:19:59.416 --> 01:20:00.124
Balls.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:05.249
Don't do this, Nakul.

01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:07.082
I'm telling you.

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:09.374
Yeah, I heard you.

01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:11.499
Now what?

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.582
Have you gone deaf? I've been
ringing the bell since half an hour!

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:40.541
I'm not a doorman!

01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:44.207
Shut up, or you'll get it from me!
I'm already pissed.

01:20:44.666 --> 01:20:45.582
Go ahead.

01:20:46.624 --> 01:20:47.457
Hit me!

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:51.249
Show me.
What's that under your eye?

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:54.249
Who did it? Tell me...

01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:55.624
Will you tell me or not!

01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:58.749
There's this guy at school.
Sumit Malik.

01:20:59.166 --> 01:21:01.249
Hey Gular. Oi!

01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:10.999
What's this I'm hearing?
You should talk to your Dad, dude...

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:16.707
At this ripe old age... He's
still dirty dancing with your mom?

01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:22.374
Speak up!

01:21:22.916 --> 01:21:25.374
Should he be doing
it with your mom, then?

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:36.749
You've got neither brains, nor balls!

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:42.124
Look at your face!
Couldn't even put up a fight...

01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:48.291
Come. Let's go to his place
and beat the shit out of him!

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.457
What about the other
guys who were there?

01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:00.624
The thing you told that guy...

01:22:02.999 --> 01:22:05.499
I said the same thing to someone else.

01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:09.249
Not that Dad's left
us with much to say.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:17.624
Is that why you're drinking?

01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:23.124
Will you have some?

01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:25.249
I could try it...

01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:27.916
You want to drink, you son of a gun?

01:22:27.916 --> 01:22:29.874
Don't get my Dad into it!

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:33.624
Why, is he only your Dad?

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.457
Is he not my Dad too?

01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:37.957
"Don't get my Dad into it!"

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:48.499
Enough is enough, Gular...

01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:55.457
No more hiding.

01:23:05.374 --> 01:23:06.249
How about you...

01:23:10.874 --> 01:23:12.374
How about you go to my...

01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:27.249
How about you go to my Daddy!

01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:34.624
Hey Nandu, rub lime on it, dude!

01:23:38.374 --> 01:23:39.499
Hey there, big boy!

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:41.249
You're Sumit Malik, right?

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:42.582
Yeah, you got a problem?

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:45.249
Don't you hang outwith Rathi,
the student leader?

01:23:45.416 --> 01:23:46.124
Yeah.

01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:49.499
He's a chatty fellow, isn't he?

01:23:51.249 --> 01:23:53.249
Didn't he ever tell
you about Nakul Kaushik?

01:23:56.166 --> 01:23:58.999
Didn't he mention how many
skulls we cracked in our school years?

01:24:02.374 --> 01:24:03.874
You know he's my brother, right?

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:07.624
Actually, I...

01:24:07.791 --> 01:24:09.582
Does Rathi know you hit him?

01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:18.874
I stopped getting into
fights only cause Mom said so.

01:24:21.166 --> 01:24:23.082
But you're talking
shit about my parents!

01:24:25.874 --> 01:24:27.249
Itching to get into trouble?

01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.624
Gular, come hit him.

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:33.999
Sorry, bro!

01:24:34.166 --> 01:24:36.249
- And his cap must fly off.
- Sony, bro!

01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:42.499
Didn't cut it.

01:24:42.916 --> 01:24:43.874
Give me the bag.

01:24:45.499 --> 01:24:47.082
He won't mind. He's a cooperative kid.

01:24:54.624 --> 01:24:58.374
Look Gular... If his cap
doesn't come off this time...

01:24:58.999 --> 01:25:02.124
I'm gonna thrash him, and you too.

01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.499
Hit him!

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:05.832
Lower your hand!

01:25:25.666 --> 01:25:28.374
Bro... Did I hit him hard?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.249
His ears must be still ringing.

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:36.082
- Tell me something.
- What?

01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:38.082
Have you thought about it...

01:25:38.291 --> 01:25:39.832
Whether it'll be a boy or a girl?

01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:41.749
Not really. What about you?

01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:44.874
Me neither.
What's the point, anyway...

01:25:46.166 --> 01:25:49.374
Did you ever imagine
we'd be discussing this!

01:25:53.916 --> 01:25:55.999
Hey! Hey Nakul, Nakul!

01:25:56.916 --> 01:25:58.374
Come on, here!

01:26:00.499 --> 01:26:01.457
He's here, finally!

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:11.124
Congratulations and celebrations...

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:12.374
Congrats, big brother!

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:23.332
You went into hiding, dude!

01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:24.624
Yeah man!

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:27.041
At least celebrate the
good news with your friends!

01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:29.499
Why keep it all to yourself, eh?

01:26:30.249 --> 01:26:33.999
After all, happiness multiplies
when it's shared, right?

01:26:35.041 --> 01:26:39.332
Uncle! Have you congratulated
our friend Nakul yet?

01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:40.874
What for?

01:26:41.249 --> 01:26:45.999
Our buddy Nakul is going
to be a big brother again!

01:26:47.249 --> 01:26:48.499
Congratulations, Sir!

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:53.582
Go on Junney, roast me.

01:26:56.416 --> 01:26:57.999
What are you looking at, rascals!

01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:02.874
Junney's proven this today...

01:27:02.874 --> 01:27:04.499
Among all of you, he's my best friend.

01:27:04.666 --> 01:27:06.249
My dearest!

01:27:06.624 --> 01:27:09.999
Look at him... he's
so happy about the baby!

01:27:11.166 --> 01:27:15.249
Even though he can
never father one himself!

01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:19.374
It's okay Junney, don't worry...

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.832
You're like a brother to me! When you
get married... Send your wife to me.

01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:23.832
It's the least I can do for you.

01:27:29.207 --> 01:27:30.666
Actually, you don't need me...

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:37.416
How about you go to my Daddy?

01:27:45.082 --> 01:27:47.957
Uncle, make him a sweet paan!

01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:50.166
Have a seat!

01:27:57.999 --> 01:27:59.207
What are you drinking?

01:27:59.957 --> 01:28:01.041
Cumin water.

01:28:01.499 --> 01:28:02.999
Oh yes, tea causes acidity.

01:28:03.457 --> 01:28:06.374
Here, take your pick.

01:28:07.124 --> 01:28:09.374
He took me to Delhi
to shop for sarees.

01:28:09.707 --> 01:28:13.249
But they were too dull.
I didn't like any of them.

01:28:13.416 --> 01:28:14.832
We bought these from the local store.

01:28:14.832 --> 01:28:16.582
Look, how lovely they are!

01:28:17.582 --> 01:28:19.166
I've already chosen mine.

01:28:19.332 --> 01:28:20.166
Ma!

01:28:20.791 --> 01:28:21.832
Ma!

01:28:23.791 --> 01:28:25.791
This is for you!

01:28:33.082 --> 01:28:37.541
Why Priyam, are they not
classy enough for your taste?

01:28:38.332 --> 01:28:39.749
No Jiji, it's not like that...

01:28:39.749 --> 01:28:41.207
No, it's okay...

01:28:41.499 --> 01:28:45.457
You've turned very modern
living in the big city, haven't you?

01:28:46.374 --> 01:28:48.666
Everyone was talking
about you at the wedding.

01:28:49.707 --> 01:28:54.374
Look Priyam, we're past
the age to taunt and bicker.

01:28:55.166 --> 01:28:57.499
But you should have thought
about the family's reputation, no?

01:28:58.707 --> 01:29:03.666
Even Shanoo's mother-in-law
asked me about Priyam...

01:29:03.874 --> 01:29:05.916
I was so embarrassed!

01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:08.707
You need to think of
how it would impact the kids...

01:29:10.124 --> 01:29:11.374
What people would say...

01:29:12.082 --> 01:29:16.124
The boys didn't turn up for
their sister's wedding out of shame!

01:29:16.707 --> 01:29:19.041
And what values will they receive?

01:29:19.416 --> 01:29:23.999
Ah! You're one to talk
about values, Guddan!

01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:31.041
Don't values tell you to
take care of your old parents?

01:29:31.874 --> 01:29:33.166
Did you do it?

01:29:35.291 --> 01:29:39.666
And you, sitting there
like a high priestess!

01:29:41.207 --> 01:29:44.707
Tell me, do you even
know what medicines I take?

01:29:45.999 --> 01:29:48.166
In fact, do you even
know about my ailments?

01:29:50.082 --> 01:29:52.874
Last year, when I was in hospital...

01:29:53.332 --> 01:29:54.832
Did any of you visit?

01:29:56.541 --> 01:29:58.624
Ma, we did come once...

01:29:58.624 --> 01:30:01.207
Wow, I should be eternally grateful!

01:30:02.957 --> 01:30:07.957
When I was sick, crapping and
pissing in bed, were any of you there?

01:30:08.207 --> 01:30:10.666
She was there.
She took care of everything!

01:30:10.874 --> 01:30:11.832
Let it go, Ma.

01:30:12.082 --> 01:30:12.957
Shut up!

01:30:13.874 --> 01:30:17.457
She washed and bathed me,
cleaned my bed...

01:30:17.707 --> 01:30:20.457
Got a folding bed and
stayed with me all night...

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:23.207
And you'll teach her about values!

01:30:28.916 --> 01:30:33.707
I've come here after so many years...

01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:37.874
Did any of you even ask...

01:30:38.624 --> 01:30:41.457
If I'd like to stay on
for a few days after the wedding?

01:30:42.874 --> 01:30:44.874
And you talk about family!

01:30:45.749 --> 01:30:49.416
She's selflessly cared for
our family and never uttered a word!

01:30:50.416 --> 01:30:51.749
Enough, Ma...

01:30:51.749 --> 01:30:53.874
Let me speak, Priyamvada!

01:30:56.499 --> 01:31:00.249
Very concerned about
Nakul and Gular, are you?

01:31:00.249 --> 01:31:03.124
I say, it's good they
didn't come for the wedding!

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:06.999
Listen! <i>Ma's</i> exploding inside. Hurry!

01:31:06.999 --> 01:31:08.082
What happened?

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:15.707
Is it a crime for a husband
and wife to be in love?

01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:19.082
- No, tell me!
- Ma!

01:31:20.999 --> 01:31:22.916
Now that Shanoo's married...

01:31:23.082 --> 01:31:26.624
...in a year you'll start
pestering her to have a baby!

01:31:26.874 --> 01:31:30.916
Are babies born out of thin air?

01:31:31.166 --> 01:31:32.666
Without having sexy?

01:31:32.666 --> 01:31:35.499
Aunty, it's not 'sexy', it's sex!

01:31:35.499 --> 01:31:37.291
Who the hell are you? Get lost!

01:31:37.457 --> 01:31:39.082
Take him away!

01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:41.582
Ma, what are you doing...

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:44.207
The atmosphere will be ruined...

01:31:45.332 --> 01:31:48.874
<i>Jiji, you both go... I'll speak to Ma.</i>

01:31:49.624 --> 01:31:52.041
It's her medication...
it gets to her head.

01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:55.916
<i>Bhabhi, calm down...</i>

01:32:01.499 --> 01:32:05.791
Ma, at such an occasion...
Why spoil the festive mood?

01:32:05.999 --> 01:32:08.957
Ask her... Did I start it?

01:32:10.082 --> 01:32:12.957
Even since I came here,
I've been noticing their attitude.

01:32:13.499 --> 01:32:17.957
And today,
Guddan questioned Priyamvada's values!

01:32:18.207 --> 01:32:20.416
Ma, how does it matter what she says?

01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:22.291
No, Jeetu! Listen to me.

01:32:22.291 --> 01:32:26.499
Yes, I'm listening. Please calm down.
Sit, relax and tell me.

01:32:27.624 --> 01:32:32.249
Your father - may
his soul rest in peace...

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:37.624
He didn't make one
good decision in his life...

01:32:38.666 --> 01:32:43.416
He got you engaged
Without my approval...

01:32:46.457 --> 01:32:47.416
Ma...

01:32:47.416 --> 01:32:53.291
But luckily, God guided him...

01:32:54.957 --> 01:32:57.957
And made sure he left
someone to take care of me...

01:32:59.499 --> 01:33:03.874
Such a wonderful daughter-in-law...

01:33:09.957 --> 01:33:12.166
I've never praised her before...

01:33:13.207 --> 01:33:16.374
But I had to say it today.

01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:25.291
Jeetu, take me back home.

01:33:27.874 --> 01:33:34.124
And don't you dare hold
a grudge against my grandsons!

01:33:35.249 --> 01:33:38.416
Absolutely not, Ma. No grudges.

01:33:38.791 --> 01:33:40.624
You calm down, please. Okay?

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:45.957
- Will you have some water?
- Yes.

01:33:46.874 --> 01:33:48.457
- I'll get you water.
- Okay.

01:33:50.416 --> 01:33:51.416
Sit down.

01:34:05.999 --> 01:34:07.332
God bless you.

01:34:13.666 --> 01:34:16.166
You get a live feed directly
on your smartphones.

01:34:16.416 --> 01:34:18.249
In a nutshell,
what we are saying is that...

01:34:18.249 --> 01:34:20.832
...with Godrej's Eve-home cams,
you can watch over your loved ones...

01:34:20.832 --> 01:34:22.832
...from anywhere, at any time.

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.249
Fabulous. Works for me. Guys?

01:34:25.582 --> 01:34:26.707
Yeah,fine.

01:34:27.332 --> 01:34:28.999
So, the campaign's final...

01:34:29.332 --> 01:34:30.541
Let's all go out for a drink?

01:34:30.541 --> 01:34:31.624
Sure, sure.

01:34:32.082 --> 01:34:32.874
Reneé?

01:34:34.041 --> 01:34:35.749
Not today. I have some work.

01:34:41.499 --> 01:34:42.249
Listen...

01:34:42.707 --> 01:34:44.082
Is there some tension
between you guys?

01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:45.666
See you guys.

01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:47.249
You're coming to the party, right?

01:34:50.874 --> 01:34:52.166
Mom and Dad are back.

01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:56.291
Where's Mom?

01:35:28.832 --> 01:35:29.582
Mom?

01:35:39.916 --> 01:35:41.124
Have you eaten, son?

01:36:06.124 --> 01:36:09.082
Go, meet your Grandma and Dad.

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:37.124
Bless you, my son.

01:36:39.374 --> 01:36:44.541
Your mother was so stressed,
she didn't smile the entire wedding.

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:47.582
Ma, your medicine.
I'll get you some water.

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:53.957
Dad...

01:36:57.041 --> 01:36:57.749
Sorry.

01:37:15.332 --> 01:37:19.832
See, your father's such a softie
inside! A true poet.

01:37:20.124 --> 01:37:22.082
He's taken after you, Grandma.

01:37:22.291 --> 01:37:24.916
Yeah, and they look so alike too.

01:37:25.916 --> 01:37:27.374
The only difference is the moustache.

01:37:27.707 --> 01:37:29.499
But your Dad doesn't
even have a moustache!

01:37:31.166 --> 01:37:32.499
But you do, Grandma!

01:37:50.249 --> 01:37:52.082
The heartbeat's completely normal.

01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:58.374
Perfectly healthy baby.

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:02.624
It's getting cold...

01:38:12.041 --> 01:38:12.999
Are you Malayali?

01:38:14.957 --> 01:38:15.999
Are you having a baby too?

01:38:17.332 --> 01:38:18.791
Good, very good!

01:38:18.791 --> 01:38:19.791
You're at the right age.

01:38:21.832 --> 01:38:23.249
We got a little late!

01:38:24.457 --> 01:38:25.916
7 months, 2 weeks...

01:38:26.082 --> 01:38:28.249
Actually, also 2 minutes.

01:38:28.666 --> 01:38:29.624
Just kidding!

01:38:32.124 --> 01:38:33.041
What about you?

01:38:33.041 --> 01:38:33.832
No, actually...

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.374
Nakul! Let's go, son.

01:38:35.582 --> 01:38:36.416
Yes, mom.

01:38:49.999 --> 01:38:51.416
We're not so late, actually...

01:38:53.457 --> 01:38:54.916
We can still pay the
installments on our house.

01:39:03.916 --> 01:39:05.124
Looks good, right?

01:39:12.791 --> 01:39:13.832
Is she kicking?

01:39:14.124 --> 01:39:17.249
How can you say it's a she?
It could be a boy as well.

01:39:18.166 --> 01:39:19.332
It's going to be a girl.

01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:21.291
How do you know?

01:39:26.624 --> 01:39:27.666
Are you happy?

01:39:27.666 --> 01:39:28.624
Extremely.

01:39:43.332 --> 01:39:44.707
<i>- Nah“?
- Yes?</i>

01:39:47.082 --> 01:39:49.499
Son... Renee' and you
don't go together anymore?

01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:51.457
No.

01:40:02.999 --> 01:40:06.207
<i>My beloved...</i>

01:40:09.124 --> 01:40:12.124
<i>My beloved...</i>

01:40:22.124 --> 01:40:27.707
<i>Without you beside me
My days and nights feel lifeless</i>

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:33.416
<i>My beloved...</i>

01:40:34.499 --> 01:40:39.999
<i>Emptiness fills up
My promised destinies</i>

01:40:42.874 --> 01:40:45.249
<i>My beloved...</i>

01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:52.624
<i>Without you beside me
My days and nights feel lifeless</i>

01:40:52.874 --> 01:40:58.082
<i>Emptiness fills up
My promised destinies</i>

01:40:58.707 --> 01:41:03.166
<i>As we walk together to eternity</i>

01:41:04.999 --> 01:41:11.166
<i>As we walk together to eternity
Don't turn and leave midway</i>

01:41:11.416 --> 01:41:17.624
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:41:17.624 --> 01:41:22.832
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:41:22.832 --> 01:41:26.916
<i>Please, for the love of God</i>

01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:35.791
<i>Please, for the love of God
Don't break my heart this way</i>

01:41:36.082 --> 01:41:42.041
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:41:42.249 --> 01:41:46.999
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:41:56.624 --> 01:41:58.624
<i>My beloved...</i>

01:42:03.166 --> 01:42:06.124
<i>For the ones marred by separation</i>

01:42:06.499 --> 01:42:09.082
<i>Tears rain down those eyes</i>

01:42:09.457 --> 01:42:12.291
<i>The one who has loved and lost</i>

01:42:12.624 --> 01:42:15.457
<i>Keeps searching for his forever</i>

01:42:15.457 --> 01:42:18.791
<i>The one with a broken heart</i>

01:42:21.832 --> 01:42:24.332
<i>The one with a broken heart</i>

01:42:24.332 --> 01:42:27.916
<i>Searches for its missing part</i>

01:42:28.291 --> 01:42:34.499
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:42:34.499 --> 01:42:39.957
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:42:40.666 --> 01:42:46.499
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:42:46.791 --> 01:42:51.916
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:58.874
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:42:59.207 --> 01:43:07.374
<i>What if our eyes never met?
What if you looked away...</i>

01:43:16.124 --> 01:43:17.624
Not getting sleep?

01:43:23.332 --> 01:43:24.291
Want to take a stroll?

01:43:31.166 --> 01:43:32.374
You guys had a fight, didn't you?

01:43:45.124 --> 01:43:46.207
You should apologize.

01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:49.999
Why should I apologize, tell me?

01:43:53.457 --> 01:43:55.416
She's bound to be upset, isn't it?

01:43:57.624 --> 01:44:00.041
If someone spoke to me that way,
wouldn't you be angry?

01:44:02.916 --> 01:44:04.582
But then it'll look
like I was at fault.

01:44:07.332 --> 01:44:09.166
There's no point being adamant, son.

01:44:11.332 --> 01:44:15.541
You'll keep holding onto this,
and she'll move on to someone else.

01:44:20.332 --> 01:44:23.541
If you can't do it,
tell me... I'll speak to her.

01:44:25.999 --> 01:44:26.916
Listen to me.

01:44:29.124 --> 01:44:32.207
The baby shower's coming soon.
Go give them an invitation.

01:44:39.249 --> 01:44:39.832
So...

01:44:41.499 --> 01:44:43.249
Should I give her the
card in office tomorrow?

01:45:06.124 --> 01:45:07.124
Aunty, well...

01:45:07.957 --> 01:45:10.457
I don't really know where to begin.

01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:13.916
So let me just start by saying sorry.

01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:19.957
I'm genuinely extremely sorry, Aunty.

01:45:22.457 --> 01:45:26.999
I don't know if me coming here and
apologizing makes any difference...

01:45:35.582 --> 01:45:38.166
Renee and I haven't been
on talking terms lately.

01:45:43.207 --> 01:45:45.624
The way I spoke to you that night,
it's not done...

01:45:45.624 --> 01:45:46.749
I'm really embarrassed about it.

01:45:49.707 --> 01:45:52.957
I don't want Renee to
feel embarrassed because of me.

01:45:54.832 --> 01:45:58.249
I don't want her to feel
ashamed about introducing me to you.

01:46:03.707 --> 01:46:05.374
I know she's disappointed in me.

01:46:07.707 --> 01:46:09.499
And that's why I'm here to apologize.

01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:16.707
I'm not such a bad guy, Aunty...

01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:21.791
And my family, my parents...
they're also not bad people.

01:46:24.082 --> 01:46:28.749
They're very simple, normal, genuine
people with middle class values.

01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:31.499
They're good human beings.

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:39.082
And I really hope I
become like them one day.

01:46:43.874 --> 01:46:46.207
Anyhow, this is for you.

01:46:47.916 --> 01:46:49.041
The Baby Shower invite.

01:46:50.916 --> 01:46:53.874
Actually, mom wanted to give it to
you personally, but you know, she's...

01:46:58.457 --> 01:46:59.249
So Aunty...

01:47:00.749 --> 01:47:02.874
...if you can forgive me,
please do come.

01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:09.457
And if possible,
get Reneé along as well.

01:47:11.582 --> 01:47:12.874
I need to say sorry to her too.

01:47:15.582 --> 01:47:16.249
So yeah.

01:47:18.707 --> 01:47:20.291
Thanks for hearing me out.

01:47:22.457 --> 01:47:23.374
I'll take your leave.

01:47:45.749 --> 01:47:46.874
Straighten it!

01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:48.416
Upstairs, on the first floor.

01:47:48.416 --> 01:47:49.082
Gular!

01:47:49.791 --> 01:47:51.707
The wires are getting tangled.

01:47:52.124 --> 01:47:53.624
Move it to the side...
yeah, that's it.

01:47:53.832 --> 01:47:54.707
Switch it on.

01:47:57.457 --> 01:47:58.624
- Is it fine?
- Perfect.

01:48:00.499 --> 01:48:01.499
Carefully...

01:48:02.999 --> 01:48:03.832
Jeetu...

01:48:04.999 --> 01:48:09.791
Now my only prayer to
God is that you have a boy.

01:48:10.332 --> 01:48:12.082
The holy trinity will be complete.

01:48:12.332 --> 01:48:14.624
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva!

01:48:15.999 --> 01:48:18.999
Do either of them
look like a God to you?

01:48:19.457 --> 01:48:21.707
They're little demons, your grandsons!

01:48:21.707 --> 01:48:23.832
Hush! What nonsense!

01:48:26.124 --> 01:48:29.291
Ma, whether it's a boy or a girl...
it should be healthy.

01:48:30.999 --> 01:48:32.457
And to tell you the truth...

01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:34.582
I'm hoping for a daughter this time.

01:48:46.624 --> 01:48:47.624
Babli?

01:48:55.874 --> 01:48:57.457
Wait, wait, stop!

01:48:58.207 --> 01:48:59.332
What's happening?

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:00.374
Doctor...

01:49:00.832 --> 01:49:02.499
One minute... Nakul!

01:49:02.749 --> 01:49:04.207
Come here quickly, son!

01:49:14.207 --> 01:49:15.166
How's Nakul?

01:49:19.499 --> 01:49:20.666
Fine, I guess.

01:49:21.249 --> 01:49:22.582
Why, you guys don't meet in office?

01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:25.332
No.

01:49:26.499 --> 01:49:28.832
Because of his mom...
he often works from home.

01:49:35.916 --> 01:49:37.332
He was here this afternoon.

01:49:42.499 --> 01:49:43.791
He spoke less today...

01:49:45.541 --> 01:49:46.666
But he spoke well.

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.166
Like I always said...

01:49:52.207 --> 01:49:53.374
He's not a bad guy.

01:49:55.207 --> 01:49:56.749
In fact, he's rather nice.

01:50:00.749 --> 01:50:03.874
Are you going to keep staring
at my face, or will you call him now?

01:50:21.291 --> 01:50:22.666
Carefully, down the stairs...

01:50:22.666 --> 01:50:24.457
What are you standing there for?
Open the door!

01:50:24.999 --> 01:50:26.124
Carefully...

01:50:26.374 --> 01:50:27.624
Keep your right foot first...

01:50:27.624 --> 01:50:28.999
Hurry up!

01:50:29.999 --> 01:50:32.041
What are you doing?
Sit at the back with mom! I'll drive.

01:50:33.957 --> 01:50:34.957
You get Grandma and come.

01:50:34.957 --> 01:50:36.374
Why do we need Grandma there?

01:50:36.624 --> 01:50:37.416
Why don't you tell her that!

01:50:37.999 --> 01:50:38.999
Babli, is everything okay?

01:50:39.457 --> 01:50:40.749
Nakul, keep me posted!

01:50:45.916 --> 01:50:48.374
He's not picking up his phone.
I'll go see him.

01:51:02.541 --> 01:51:03.957
Nakul, drive faster.

01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:10.082
Babli? Don't worry...
We're almost there.

01:51:10.374 --> 01:51:11.332
I'm scared...

01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:15.624
It's going to be fine.
We'll be there any minute.

01:51:26.666 --> 01:51:27.624
Carefully...

01:51:27.832 --> 01:51:29.082
Take it easy on the turn!

01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:31.499
Babli, it's okay...
Wait, I'll open the door.

01:51:35.582 --> 01:51:37.624
Hold it from there.
Carefully...

01:51:58.791 --> 01:52:00.749
- Are you here to meet Nakul, dear?
- Yes.

01:52:01.041 --> 01:52:02.999
He just took his
mother to the hospital.

01:52:02.999 --> 01:52:03.874
Thank you, Aunty!

01:52:04.041 --> 01:52:05.457
I've filled the form,
I'll make the payment.

01:52:05.624 --> 01:52:07.791
Nakul! Where's Mom?

01:52:07.791 --> 01:52:10.249
She's in the emergency ward.
It'll take some time. You please sit.

01:52:10.666 --> 01:52:11.791
Dad!

01:52:13.541 --> 01:52:14.749
Is everything fine?

01:52:15.374 --> 01:52:16.666
Her water just broke.

01:52:18.207 --> 01:52:19.499
The senior doctor is on her way.

01:52:19.832 --> 01:52:21.166
They say they need to operate.

01:52:21.707 --> 01:52:22.666
Operation?

01:52:43.082 --> 01:52:44.541
- What did she say?
- Nothing...

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:47.457
- Tell me!
- It's nothing important.

01:52:47.749 --> 01:52:48.749
Come on, tell me!

01:52:49.499 --> 01:52:52.582
She was asking if you want to
go and shoot a video of the delivery.

01:52:53.124 --> 01:52:54.207
Shameless!

01:52:54.999 --> 01:52:56.082
How can you suggest something
like this to your father?

01:52:56.249 --> 01:52:58.374
- People do it nowadays.
- What rubbish!

01:52:59.457 --> 01:53:00.166
Mom!

01:54:07.082 --> 01:54:08.707
- Who's that?
- Nakul's chick!

01:54:08.957 --> 01:54:10.291
I mean, his friend.

01:54:26.582 --> 01:54:28.916
Congratulations... it's a baby girl.

01:54:29.832 --> 01:54:32.249
We were a bit concerned
because the baby was premature...

01:54:32.249 --> 01:54:34.999
...but she's absolutely healthy.
Absolutely fine.

01:54:35.666 --> 01:54:36.624
The mother's doing fine too.

01:54:36.999 --> 01:54:39.249
We'll shift both of
them to the ward shortly.

01:54:56.457 --> 01:54:57.166
Babli?

01:55:20.041 --> 01:55:20.999
How are you feeling?

01:55:22.666 --> 01:55:23.374
I'm fine.

01:55:27.457 --> 01:55:29.082
How does our little doll look?

01:55:30.582 --> 01:55:32.291
She's coming. See her for yourself.

01:56:00.707 --> 01:56:06.916
<i>Holding you warm in my arms</i>

01:56:06.916 --> 01:56:11.249
<i>I'll pamper you with endless love</i>

01:56:12.624 --> 01:56:18.582
<i>May you have the brightest dreams</i>

01:56:18.874 --> 01:56:23.374
<i>As I sing you sweet lullabies</i>

01:56:25.832 --> 01:56:31.291
<i>I pray that you live a hundred years</i>

01:56:31.707 --> 01:56:36.749
<i>I pray that you live a hundred years</i>

01:56:36.916 --> 01:56:42.249
<i>And upon myself I'll take your pain</i>

01:56:48.666 --> 01:56:54.707
<i>Holding you warm in my arms</i>

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:58.832
<i>I'll pamper you with endless love</i>

01:57:00.624 --> 01:57:06.582
<i>May you have the brightest dreams</i>

01:57:06.582 --> 01:57:10.124
<i>As I sing you sweet lullabies</i>

01:57:56.374 --> 01:57:58.457
Come Nakul, let's take a selfie.

01:58:05.707 --> 01:58:07.207
Reneé dear, come join us.

01:58:08.541 --> 01:58:09.249
Come.

01:58:15.874 --> 01:58:20.666
Jeetu... Now that we're in hospital,
you might as well get operated too...

01:58:21.166 --> 01:58:23.041
Or we might end up
here again next year!
